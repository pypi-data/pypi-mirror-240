Installation
============

To use PyTorch `transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_, `AutoGPTQ
<https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ>`_, or `AutoAWQ
<https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ>`_ models::

   pip install "cappr[hf]"

To use GGUF models::

   pip install "cappr[llama-cpp]"

To use OpenAI `/v1/completions
<https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility>`_ models
(`excluding
<https://cappr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/select_a_language_model.html#openai>`_
``gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct``), `sign up <https://platform.openai.com/signup>`_ for the
OpenAI API, set the environment variable ``OPENAI_API_KEY``, and then::

   pip install cappr

(Optional) To use any of the above model formats::

   pip install "cappr[all]"

(Optional) Install requirements for running the repo's `demos
<https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/tree/main/demos>`_::

   pip install "cappr[demos]"


Without dependencies
--------------------

For backwards compatibility reasons, installing this package installs OpenAI's Python
`API client <https://pypi.org/project/openai/>`_ and its (lightweight) dependencies. You
don't need these packages to run GGUF models. So in case you'd like a lighter install,
run these two commands (in any order) instead of the one above:

::

   pip install \
   "numpy>=1.21.0" \
   "tqdm>=4.27.0" \
   "llama-cpp-python>=0.2.11"

::

   pip install --no-deps cappr
