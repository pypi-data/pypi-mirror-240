# Great Tables

_Absolutely Delightful Table-making in Python_

With **great_tables** anyone can make wonderful-looking tables in Python. The philosophy here is that we can construct a wide variety of useful tables by working with a cohesive set of table parts. You can mix and match things like a _header_ and _footer_, attach a _stub_ (which contains row labels), arrange _spanner labels_ over top of the _column labels_, and much more. Not only that, but you can format the cell values in a variety of awesome ways.

## Installation

$ pip install great_tables
```
