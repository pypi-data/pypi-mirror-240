vivacious

	priorities:
		health scan and health advancents, 
		checked with body_scan and modules that use body_scan
		
	the structure:
	
		The idea is that building codependecies (or cyclic depedencies)
		into the status assertation framework is a recipe for confusion.
	
		As in, vivacious perhaps shouldn't include a module that
		requires vivacious for status assertation.
	
		Therefore the directed acyclic chart of status check frameworks is:
			
			[ unit test, pytest ] -> body scan -> vivacious
