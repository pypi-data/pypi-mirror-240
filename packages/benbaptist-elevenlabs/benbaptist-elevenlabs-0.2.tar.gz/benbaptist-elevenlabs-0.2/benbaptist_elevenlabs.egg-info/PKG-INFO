        NOTE: The official elevenlabs library is now available! Check it out
        `here at this link <https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python>`__.
        The PyPi package ``elevenlabs`` will now point to their official library
        moving forward. Just in case you need this library still, I went ahead
        and
        
        elevenlabs is an unofficial Python library that provides an easy-to-use
        interface for elevenlabs.io’ API. With this library, you can easily
        integrate with the API to generate voices.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install elevenlabs, run:
        
        ::
        
           pip install --upgrade elevenlabs
        
        This library requires no special dependencies, and is written in pure
        Python.
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        Here’s an example of how you can use elevenlabs to retrieve data from
        the API:
        
        ::
        
           from elevenlabs import ElevenLabs
        
           eleven = ElevenLabs(api_key)
        
           # Get a Voice object, by name or UUID
           voice = eleven.voices["Arnold"]
        
           # Generate the TTS
           audio = voice.generate("Hey buddy! It's a beautiful day.")
        
           # Save the TTS to a file named 'my_first_tts' in the working directory
           audio.save("my_first_tts")
        
        See example.py for more. For more advanced usage, refer to the
        (currently non-existent!) documentation and the API reference.
        
        See `the official ElevenLabs
        documentation <https://api.elevenlabs.io/docs>`__ for more information.
        
        Real World Example
        ==================
        
        I’m currently using this library to produce fully-automated weather
        reports on my radio station, `BMIX94 <https://listen.bmix.live>`__. For
        a sample of how it sounds, `here’s link to the latest weather
        report <https://listen.bmix.live/streams/benmixer/weather.wav>`__ that
        will actually be broadcasting at various times throughout the day. That
        link is always pointing to the most recent weather report generated.
