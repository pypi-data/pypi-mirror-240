class iovec(Structure):
    """
    Describes a region of memory, beginning at iov_base address and
    with the size of iov_len bytes.  System calls use arrays of this
    structure, where each element of the array represents a memory
    region, and the whole array represents a vector of memory
    regions. The maximum number of iovec structures in that array is
    limited by IOV_MAX (defined in <limits.h>, or accessible via the
    call sysconf(_SC_IOV_MAX)).
