*ad-physics* provides the python binding of a C++ implementation for common data types to be used in the context of automated driving (AD).This includes type safe implemenations of e.g. Distance, Speed, Duration and Acceleration and operations on those.In addition, the types define AD specific precision, minima, maxima and input range values.See [project webpage](https://ad-map-access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [doxygen docu](https://ad-map-access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ad_physics/apidoc/html/index.html) for a full interface description.
