Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young
man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a
chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed
with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and
some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week. Not all that Mrs.
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject,
was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.
They attacked him in various ways–with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions,
and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged
to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was
highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young,
wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to
be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be
fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of
Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.
