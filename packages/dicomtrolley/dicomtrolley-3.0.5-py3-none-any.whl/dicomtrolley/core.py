    Notes
    -----
    *  Different backends use slightly different query parameters. This class
       implements all common parameters.

    *  DICOM queries consist of a number of DICOM tags followed by a search
       criterion. The naming format for these parameters follows DICOM conventions
       (CamelCase). In addition, a query has non-DICOM meta-parameters. Here regular
       python (lower_case_underscore) naming is used

    General notes on subclassing Query

    A Searcher class often has its own associated Query subclass. For instance,
    the Mint searcher function Mint.find_study(query) can take a MintQuery instance
    which uniquely allows the setting of the MINT-specific parameter `limit`.
    Any Searcher can however also take a generic Query instance as input. This
    makes it possible to use a simple Query in your code and be independent
    of searcher backend.
    An issue with the scheme is that it is in principle allowed to use the Query
    baseclass as input, it should also be allowed to use any Query subclass in
    any searcher. This, for example, would be legal:

    ```python
    query = QidoRelationalQuery(qido_specific_setting=1)
    studies = Mint().find_study(query)
    ```
    This is weird but not unthinkable. The problem is that the Mint searcher
    cannot do anything with the `qido_specific_setting` set for the query. If
    Mint just uses the basic Query parameters for its query, information would
    be ignored or lost. On the other hand, if we enforce that Mint().find_study()
    only takes MintQuery objects, we lose the ability to use a Query as a
    backend-agnostic general query.

    The tradeoff in structure is between the convenience of having a
    backend-agnostic query on the one hand, and having tight type definitions
    for input arguments on the other.

    In the end, decided that the backend-agnostic query is too useful to lose.
    However, there should be no silent ignoring of parameters. So we will have
    Searcher methods raise UnSupportedParameterError if using an input query would
    result in information being lost.
