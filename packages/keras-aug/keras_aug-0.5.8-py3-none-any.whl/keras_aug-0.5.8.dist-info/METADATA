              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

</div>

> **Note**
> left: the visualization of the layers in KerasAug; right: the visualization of the YOLOV8 pipeline using KerasAug

KerasAug aims to provide fast, robust and user-friendly preprocessing and augmentation layers, facilitating seamless integration with TensorFlow, Keras and KerasCV.

KerasAug is:

- 🚀 faster than [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv) which is an official Keras library
- 🧰 supporting various data types, including **images, labels, bounding boxes, segmentation masks**, and more.
- ❤️ dependent only on TensorFlow
- 🌟 seamlessly integrating with the `tf.data` and `tf.keras.Model` APIs
- 🔥 compatible with GPU and mixed precision (`mixed_float16` and `mixed_bfloat16`)

Check out the demo website powered by Streamlit:

- Apply a transformation to the default or uploaded image
- Adjust the arguments of the specified layer

## Why KerasAug?

1. KerasAug is generally faster than KerasCV

    > RandomCropAndResize in KerasAug exhibits a remarkable speed-up of **+1150%** compared to KerasAug. See [keras-aug/benchmarks](https://github.com/james77777778/keras-aug/tree/main/benchmarks) for more details.

2. The APIs of KerasAug are highly stable compared to KerasCV

    > KerasCV struggles to reproduce the YOLOV8 training pipeline, whereas KerasAug executes it flawlessly. See [Quickstart](https://github.com/james77777778/keras-aug/tree/main#quickstart) for more details.

3. KerasAug comes with built-in support for mixed precision training

    > All layers in KerasAug can run with `tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')`

4. KerasAug offers the functionality of sanitizing bounding boxes, ensuring the validity

    > The current layers in KerasAug support the sanitizing process by incorporating the `bounding_box_min_area_ratio` and `bounding_box_max_aspect_ratio` arguments.

    > **Note**
    > The degenerate bounding boxes (those located at the bottom of the image) are removed.

    ]
)


def preprocess_data(images, labels, augment=False):
    labels = tf.one_hot(labels, NUM_CLASSES)
    inputs = {"images": images, "labels": labels}
    outputs = augmenter(inputs) if augment else inputs
    return outputs["images"], outputs["labels"]


train_dataset, test_dataset = tfds.load(
    "rock_paper_scissors", as_supervised=True, split=["train", "test"]
)
train_dataset = (
    train_dataset.batch(BATCH_SIZE)
    .map(
        lambda x, y: preprocess_data(x, y, augment=True),
        num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE,
    )
    .prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
)
test_dataset = (
    test_dataset.batch(BATCH_SIZE)
    .map(preprocess_data, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    .prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
)

# Create a model using a pretrained backbone
backbone = keras_cv.models.EfficientNetV2Backbone.from_preset(
    "efficientnetv2_b0_imagenet"
)
model = keras_cv.models.ImageClassifier(
    backbone=backbone,
    num_classes=NUM_CLASSES,
    activation="softmax",
)
model.compile(
    loss="categorical_crossentropy",
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-5),
    metrics=["accuracy"],
)

# Train your model
model.fit(
    train_dataset,
    validation_data=test_dataset,
    epochs=8,
)
```

```bash
# KerasCV Quickstart
...
Epoch 8/8
158/158 [==============================] - 39s 242ms/step - loss: 0.7930 - accuracy: 0.7171 - val_loss: 0.2488 - val_accuracy: 0.9946

# KerasAug Quickstart
...
Epoch 8/8
158/158 [==============================] - 34s 215ms/step - loss: 0.7680 - accuracy: 0.7567 - val_loss: 0.2639 - val_accuracy: 1.0000
```

KerasAug runs faster (215ms/step vs. 242ms/step) than KerasCV and achieves better performance.
