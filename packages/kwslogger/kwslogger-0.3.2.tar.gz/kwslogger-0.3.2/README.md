## 🚀 Usage

Normal logs for your tools
```python
from kwslogger import Logger

# Create a logger instance
logger = Logger(log_level="ANY", log_to_file=True, log_file_name="mylogs", log_file_mode="a")

# Clear the console
logger.clear()

# Log a message
logger.welcome("I'm a welcome message!")
logger.info("I'm an info message!")
logger.debug("I'm a debug message!")
logger.success("I'm a success message!")
logger.warning("I'm a warning!")
logger.error("I'm an error!")
logger.input("I'm an input message!")
logger.ratelimit("I'm a rate limit message!")
```

Animated Sleeps
```python
from kwslogger import Logger

# Create a logger instance
logger = Logger()

logger.sleep("Waiting for 1 second...", 1)
```

Run functions while you showing the spinner with an optional timer
```python
from kwslogger import Logger

# Create a logger instance
logger = Logger()

def test_func(number1, number2):
    answer = number1 + number2
    return answer

result = logger.run_with_spinner(test_func, "Calculating...", True, 1, 1)
print(str(result) + " (Func returned)")
```

Filter out your logs with the built in log levels, anything above the level you set on the logger instace won't be logged nor written to the file.
```text
debug (0) --> info (1) --> welcome (2) --> success (3) --> warning (4) --> error (5) --> input (6) --> ratelimit (7) --> sleep (8) --> any (9)
```
Example:
```python

from kwslogger import Logger

# Create a logger instance
logger = Logger(log_level="WARNING", log_to_file=True, log_file_name="mylogs", log_file_mode="a")

print(logger.can_log("INFO")) # --> True because it's below warning level. Would log and write to the file.
print(logger.can_log("RATELIMIT")) # --> False because it's above the warning level. Wouldn't log nor write to the file.
```
You don't need to filter out the logs with this method, it's done automatically, this is just an example and a method added to check whether a log should be logged or not.

Create progress bars with ease.
```python
import time
from kwslogger import Logger

logger = Logger()

for i in (logger.progress_bar(range(100), desc="Progress Bar", unit="items", unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=100, miniters=1, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=1, dynamic_ncols=True, smoothing=0.3, bar_format="{l_bar}{bar}| {n_fmt}/{total_fmt} [{elapsed}<{remaining}]", leave=False)):
    time.sleep(0.1)
```
You can add as many arguments and customizations as the tqdm library supports.

Create logos with just 1 function
```python
from kwslogger import Logger

logger = Logger()

logger.create_logo("Pluto Reportbot")
```
You can use a custom `pyfiglet` font with the following
```python
logger.create_logo("Pluto Reportbot", font = "slant")
```

Generate QR Codes with 1 call
```python
from kwslogger import Logger

logger = Logger()

logger.generate_qr("https://hvh.bio/")
```
