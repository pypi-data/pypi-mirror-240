JokerSDK
========
JokerSDK is a flexible and user-friendly Python library wrapping around [Joker](https://jokerapi.co/)'s Voice API.

## Key Features
 - Creating outbound voice calls.
 - Playing audio/text into live calls.
 - Gathering DTMF with audio/text from live calls.
 - Transferring recipients from Leg A to Leg B.
 - Sending DTMF into a live call.

## Requirements
 - Python >= 3.10

## To do
 - Fix type hints.
 - Redo docs, add docs.
 - Integrate callback class.

Guide - How to install JokerSDK
-------------------------------
JokerSDK via PyPi:
``` console
$ pip install JokerSDK
```
Or, if you wish to download it directly from this repository:
``` console
$ python setup.py install
```

JokerSDK - Usage
----------------

Create an outbound call
-----------------------
``` python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "API_KEY", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)
```

Object attributes
-----------------
```python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "API_KEY", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)

callSid = call.sid # Access the SID of the call.
retrieved = call.__retrieve__ # Boolean to check if the call has been retrieved or not.
staticStatus = call._sid # A static status indicating if the call has been terminated. This is inferred and does not reflect the actual state of the call.
```

Play audio into a call.
-----------------------
``` python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "API_KEY", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)

call.play_audio(
    audioUrl = "https://my.cdnserver.xyz/JokerSDK/audio.wav" # A web server which holds the audio file to play.
)
```

Play text into a call.
----------------------
``` python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "API_KEY", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)

call.play_text(
    text = "This is an example phrase of in what will be presented into a live call/channel", # A phrase which JokerAPI will synthesise.
    voice = "ai3-en-US-Madison" # The voice name of in which JokerAPI will synthesise with.
)
```

Gathering DTMF whilst playing Audio
-----------------------------------
``` python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "<API_KEY>", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)

call.gather_dtmf_with_audio(
    audioUrl = "https://my.cdnserver.xyz/JokerSDK/audio.wav", # A web server which holds the audio file to play.
    maxDigits = 5 # The amount of digits which will be captured before calling back.
)
```

Gathering DTMF whilst playing Text
----------------------------------
``` python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "<API_KEY>", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)

call.gather_dtmf_with_text(
    text = "This is an example phrase of in what will be presented into a live call/channel", # A phrase which JokerAPI will synthesise.
    voice = "ai3-en-US-Madison", # The voice name of in which JokerAPI will synthesise with.
    maxDigits = 5 # The amount of digits which will be captured before calling back.
)
```

Send DTMF tones
---------------
``` python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "<API_KEY>", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)

call.send_dtmf(
    input_ = "1234" # Digits to Send DTMF tones to Leg B(to) from.
)
```

Retrieve an session.
--------------------
``` python
call = JokerAPI.client.retrieve(
    apiKey = "<API_KEY>", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    sid = "1234567890" # A valid identifier in which to retrieve.
)
```
Every object attribute & function from the `retrieve` class is interconnected with the `create_outbound_call` class.

Finally, hang up the call.
--------------------------
``` python
import JokerAPI

call = JokerAPI.client.create_outbound_call(
    apiKey = "<API_KEY>", # Your API Key, this can be found on site.
    to = "1234567890", # The number to call.
    from_ = "1987654321", # The number to call `to` from.
    callbackUrl = "https://my.callbackserver.xyz/JokerSDK/callbacks" # A web server to send all callbacks to.
)
```

Callback class demo
--------------------
``` python
import JokerAPI
from flask import Flask, request


def callBacks():
    requestPayload = request.json

    if not all(requiredParameters in requestPayload for requiredParameters in ['status', 'callsid']):
        # At this point, the request is invalid/malformed.
        return "Invalid.Parameters" # You can return any value.

    call = JokerAPI.client.retrieve(apiKey = "API_KEY" sid = requestPayload['callsid'])

    match requestPayload['status']:
        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.RINGING:
            print("The call is ringing!")

        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.ANSWERED:
            print("The call has been answered, waiting for voicemail detection!") # Only if Voicemail detection is enabled, if not skip to detection
        
        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.VOICEMAIL_DETECTED:
            print("The system has detected that this call is not legitimate, hanging up!")
            call.hangup()
        
        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.HUMAN_DETECTED:
            print("The system has detected that this call is legit, we will play some text into the call!")
            call.play_text(text = "This is the text that will be presented into the call!")
        
        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.NOTSURE_DETECTED:
            print("The system couldn't detect the integrity of this call, hanging up!")
            call.hangup()
        
        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.DTMF_RECIEVED:
            digit = request.json['digit']
            print(f"The user[Leg(b)] has entered a DTMF digit!, Digit: {digit}")
            call.play_text(text = f"You have entered the DTMF digit {digit}")
        
        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.DTMF_GATHERED:
            digits = request.json['digits']
            print(f"The system has gathered multiple DTMF digits!, Digit: {digits}")
            call.play_text(text = f"You have entered multiple DTMF digits {digits}")
        
        case JokerAPI.callback.Enums.HANGUP:
            print("The recipient has hung up the call.")

    return "JokerSDK/Demo"

# Create a web app server for webhooks.
server = JokerAPI.client.callback_server(
    Flask(__name__)
)

server.addCallbackEndpoint(
    callBacks
)

server.createCallbackServer()
```
