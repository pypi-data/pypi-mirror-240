        This the weighted non-conjoint measures, namely, rank-biased overlap.
        Unlike Kendall tau which is correlation based, this is intersection

        The implementation if from Eq. (4) or Eq. (7) (for p != 1) from the
        RBO paper: http://www.williamwebber.com/research/papers/wmz10_tois.pdf

        If p = 1, it returns to the un-bounded set-intersection overlap,
        according to Fagin et al.
        https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-fagin/topk.pdf

        The fig. 5 in that RBO paper can be used as test case.
        Note there the choice of p is of great importance, since it
        essentially control the "top-weightness". Simply put, to an extreme,
        a small p value will only consider first few items, whereas a larger p
        value will consider more items. See Eq. (21) for quantitative measure.

            k: The depth of evaluation.
            p: Weight of each agreement at depth d:

                to average overlap.
