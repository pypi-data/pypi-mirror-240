           (and therefore changed) entry and remove the label from `Database._unsaved_entries`.
        5. Using `Entry.save` and a `cobib.parsers.YAMLParser` we overwrite the previous lines of
           the changed entry.
        6. Finally, all labels still left in `Database._unsaved_entries` are newly added entries and
           can simply be appended to the file.
