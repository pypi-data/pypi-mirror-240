# Device login provides a convenient and secure way to log into SSO-enabled
# services on a secondary device without entering the user password or
# completing 2FA challenges.
#
# Use-cases:
# * A user wants to log into a single OAuth2-enabled web service on his
#   mobile phone without trusting the device enough to expose his full
#   credentials.
# * A user wants to log into an OAuth2-enabled web service on a secondary
#   device at a busy event location with too little privacy to securly enter
#   his credentials but already has a login session on his laptop.
# * A user wants to log into an OAuth2-enabled service via the web browser
#   on a native mobile app on his phone and cannot use his 2FA method on that
#   device (e.g. FIDO2 token with USB-A) or in the app's web view.

# The mechanism uses two random codes: When the user attempts to authenticate
# with an SSO-enabled service and chooses the "Device Login" option on the SSO
# login page, the SSO generates and displays an initiation code. That code is
# securly bound to the browser session that is used to request it. The user
# logs into the SSO on another device using his credentials and 2FA methods and
# opens a page to authorize the device login attempt. There he enteres the
# initiation code. The SSO displays the details of the device login attempt
# (i.e. the name of the service to log into). Once the user authorizes the
# login attempt, the SSO generates a confirmation code and displays it to the
# user. The user enters the confirmation code on the device he wants to log
# in with and proceeds with the authentication.
#
# An attacker might
# * generate initiation codes,
# * observe the displayed/entered initiation code,
# * observe the displayed/entered confirmation code and
# * possibly divert the victims attention and provoke typing errors.
#
# An attacker must not be able to
# * authenticate with an SSO-enabled service as another user or
# * trick a user to authenticate with an SSO-enabled service as the attacker.
#
# An example for the second case would be the Nextcloud mobile app: The app
# integrates closely with the phone's OS and provides features like
# auto-upload of photos, contacts and more. If the app would authenticate
# with an attacker-controlled account, the attacker would have access to
# this data.
