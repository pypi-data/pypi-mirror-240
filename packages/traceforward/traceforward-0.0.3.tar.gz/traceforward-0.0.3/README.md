# Traceforward

Forward Networks utility that enhances traceroute experience, extending original traceroute output
with useful information from Forward.

The tool expects Forward Server data to be present in configuration file:
```shell
âžœ  cat ~/.traceforward/traceForwardConfig.ini
[FORWARD_SERVER]
url = <FORWARD_SERVER_URL>
username = <USERNAME>
password = <USERNAME>
network_id = <NETWORK_ID>
```
If this file is not present, for example during the first run, the tool will
prompt for the information and create config folder and file.

## For developers
