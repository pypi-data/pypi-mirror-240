- Partial Least Squares using the NIPALS algorithm
- Multiple Linear Regression using the Ordinary Least Squares algorithm
- Fisher Linear Discrimnant Analysis 
- KMeans and Hierarchical clustering
- Matrix/vector/tensor operations (products, matrix inversions using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm, and so on)
- Descriptive statistics for regression and classification problems.
- Model validation with leave-one-out and Bootstrap random kfold cross validation
- Variable selection using genetic and metaheuristic algorithms
- Solve linear system of equations
