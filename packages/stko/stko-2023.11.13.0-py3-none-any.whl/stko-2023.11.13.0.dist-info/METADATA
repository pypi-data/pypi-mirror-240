Overview
========

``stko`` is a Python library which allows for the optimisation and
property calculation of molecules constructed using the library
``stk`` https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk. There is a Discord server
for ``stk``, which can be joined through https://discord.gg/zbCUzuxe2B.


Installation
============

To get ``stko``, you can install it with pip::

    $ pip install stko

You can also install xtb, which is an optional dependency::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge xtb

You can also install openbabel, which is an optional dependency::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge openbabel

You can also install MDAnalysis, which is an optional dependency::

    $ conda install -c mdanalysis

Examples
========

We are constantly trying to add examples to the ``examples/`` directory
and maintain examples in the doc strings of ``Calculator`` and
``Optimizer`` classes.

``examples/basic_examples.py`` highlights basic optimisation with
``rdkit``, ``openbabel`` and ``xtb`` (if you have ``xtb`` available).


How To Contribute
=================

If you have any questions or find problems with the code, please submit
an issue.

If you wish to add your own code to this repository, please send us a
Pull Request. Please maintain the testing and style that is used
throughout ```stko``.
