# ai-einblick-prompt

`ai-einblick-prompt` empowers JupyterLab users with a domain-specific AI agent that can generate, modify, and fix code for data science workflows. Einblick's extension is the easiest and only context-aware way to augment the data workflow with generative AI.

## [Einblick Prompt AI](https://www.einblick.ai/ai-einblick-prompt/)

Einblick is the AI-native data notebook that can write and fix code, create beautiful charts, build models, and much more. This is made possible via our domain-specific AI agent, Einblick Prompt. Visit our [homepage](https://www.einblick.ai/) to learn more about Einblick.
