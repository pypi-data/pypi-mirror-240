# FWAdmin: a Firewall manager and viewer plugin for Netbox

FWAdmin is a [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox "NetBox") plugin designed to manage time-based remote access to equipment. It has been developed based on the requirements of several customers I have interacted with in recent years.

FWAdmin implements External Dynamic Lists (EDL), which are dynamically populated based on a straightforward workflow involving datetime and user requests.
