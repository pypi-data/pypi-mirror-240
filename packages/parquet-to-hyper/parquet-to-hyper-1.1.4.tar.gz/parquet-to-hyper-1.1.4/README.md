Package to convert parquet files into a single hyper file. 

## Benchmarking

The package was benchmarked using a Latitude 3420 Dell Notebook with 16GB of Memory RAM, a 250GB SSD, and an i7-1165G7 CPU. The time may vary using different architectures. The table used for benchmarking contained **60 columns**. Although the tests were carried with a maximum of 500 million of rows, the package supports higher amount of volume. The limitation is only to the size of a single parquet file (up to 30GB). For larger volumes, it's recommended to split them into multiple parquet files. Follow the results:

| Rows (in millions) | Time (in seconds) | Parquet size (in MegaBytes) |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1                  | 4.05              | 54                          |
| 10                 | 36.8              | 520                         |
| 100                | 412.6             | 4900                        |
| 500                | 2669.25           | 25400                       |

## How to use

### Installation

```shell
pip install parquet-to-hyper
```

### Initializing object

```python
from packages.hyper_file import HyperFile

parquet_folder = '/path/to/your/folder'             # The folder where the parquet files are
parquet_extension = 'parquet'                       # Optional. Don't use it if the parquet files has no extension
hf = HyperFile(parquet_folder, parquet_extension)
```

### Create a single file

```python
hyper_filename = 'path/to/your/db.hyper'            # Path to save hyper file with filename
rows = hf.create_hyper_file(hyper_file_name)
print(f'Hyper created with {rows} rows.')
```

### Deleting rows from an existing hyper file

This function deletes rows based on a control column (date column) and the days to delete from current day.

```python
hyper_filename = 'path/to/your/db.hyper'            # Path to load hyper file with filename
control_column = 'date_column'
days = 7
hf.delete_rows(hyper_filename)
print(f'{rows} rows were deleted.')
```

### Appending rows from parquet into an existing hyper file

```python
hyper_filename = 'path/to/your/db.hyper'            # Path to load hyper file with filename
rows  = hf.append_rows(hyper_filename)
print(f'{rows} were appended.')
```

### Publishing hyper file into Tableau server

```python
from packages.hyper_file import HyperFile

tsu = TableauServerUtils(tableau_address, token_name, token_value)
project_id = tsu.get_project_id(project_name)
tsu.publish_hyper(project_id, 'test.hyper')
```
