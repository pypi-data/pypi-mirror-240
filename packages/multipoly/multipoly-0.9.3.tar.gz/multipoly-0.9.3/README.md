# multipoly

A multivariate polynomial module.

This package provides a single class, `MultiPoly`, to handle multivariate polynomials of form

$$
    p(\vec{x}) = \sum_{0\leq n\leq\deg(p)}a_n(\vec{x}-\vec{c})^n = \sum_{n_0=0}^{\deg_0(p)}\cdots\sum_{n_{\dim(p)-1}=0}^{\deg_{\dim(p)-1}(p)}a_{n_0\cdots n_{\dim(p)-1}}(x_0-c_0)^{n_0}\cdots(x_{\dim(p)-1}-c_{\dim(p)-1})^{n_{\dim(p)-1}}
$$

where $n$ and $\deg(p)$ are multi-indices.
This differs from the usual upper sum limit $|n|\leq\deg(p)$ where $n$ is a multi-index and $\deg(p)$ a natural number,
because this way the degree in every variable can be controlled individually.

## Installation

```
pip install multipoly
```

## Usage

A polynomial can be initialized in two ways:
 - With the constructor `Multipoly(a, c=None)`, that takes the coefficients and optional offsets.
  The coefficients are of shape `deg`, that is a tuple with the degree for every variable.
 - By fitting data with `Multipoly.fit(X, y, deg, c=None)`.

`MultiPoly` objects have
- a dimension `dim`, the number of variables &
- a degree `deg`, the degrees in its variables.

They can
- be called on a single datapoint `p(x, y, ...)` or on multiple datapoints in a 2D `numpy.array`,
- rounded `p.round(decimals=0)`, to round coefficients `a` and offsets `c` &
- be converted to strings with `toString(symbols=None)`, where the symbols for its variables can be specified
  (`__str__` defaults to `x0, x1, ...`).
