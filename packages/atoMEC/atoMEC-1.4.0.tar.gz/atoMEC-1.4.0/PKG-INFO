# atoMEC: Average-Atom Code for Matter under Extreme Conditions

atoMEC is a python-based average-atom code for simulations of high energy density phenomena such as in warm dense matter.
It is designed as an open-source and modular python package.

atoMEC uses Kohn-Sham density functional theory, in combination with an average-atom approximation,
to solve the electronic structure problem for single-element materials at finite temperature.

More information on the average-atom methodology and Kohn-Sham density functional theory can be found (for example) in this [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.023055) and references therein.

This repository is structured as follows:
```
├── atoMEC : source code
├── docs : sphinx documentation
├── examples : simple examples to get you started with the package
└── tests : CI tests
```


## Installation

The latest stable release of `atoMEC` can be installed via `pip`. It is first necessary to install the `libxc` package from a tarball source, because it currently has no official wheels distribution on PyPI. This step takes some time.

```sh
$ pip install https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc/-/archive/6.2.2/libxc-6.2.2.tar.gz
$ pip install atoMEC
```

Note that atoMEC does not (yet) support Windows installation (please see the section below on supported operating systems).

Read on for instructions on how to install `atoMEC` from source, using the recommended `pipenv` installation route.

### Installation via `pipenv`

First, clone the atoMEC repository and ``cd`` into the main directory.

* It is recommended to install atoMEC inside a virtual environment. Below, we detail how to achive this with [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).

  This route is recommended because `pipenv` automatically creates a virtual environment and manages dependencies. Note that `pyblibxc` is automatically installed in this case, so there is no need to install it separately.

  1. First, install `pipenv` if it is not already installed, for example via `pip install pipenv` (or see [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) for installation instructions)
  2. Next, install `atoMEC`'s dependencies with `pipenv install` (use `--dev` option to install the test dependencies in the same environment)
  3. Use `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment
  4. Install atoMEC with `pip install atoMEC` (for developers: `pip install -e .`)
  5. Now run scripts from inside the `atoMEC` virtual environment, e.g. `python examples/simple.py`

* Run the tests (see Testing section below) and report any failures (for example by raising an issue).

### Supported operating systems

* **Linux and macOS**: atoMEC has been installed on various linux distributions and macOS, and is expected to work for most distributions and versions
* **Windows**: atoMEC does **not** support Windows installation. This is due to the dependency on `pylibxc` which currently lacks Windows support. We are looking into ways to make the dependency on `pylibxc` optional, in order to allow installation on Windows. However, this is not currently a priority.


### Supported Python versions

* atoMEC has been tested and is expected to work for all Python versions >= 3.8 and <= 3.12
* atoMEC does not work for Python <= 3.7
* Until 09.10.2023 (release 1.4.0), all development and CI testing was done with Python 3.8. As of this date, development and CI testing is done with Python 3.12.
* Python 3.12 is therefore the recommended version for atoMEC >= 1.4.0, since this is used for the current testing and development environment


## Running
You can familiarize yourself with the usage of this package by running the example scripts in `examples/`.

## Contributing to atoMEC
We welcome your contributions, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to the code:
* In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `develop` and merge requests should be to `develop`
* Please choose a descriptive branch name
* Merges from `develop` to `master` will be done after prior consultation of the core development team
* Merges from `develop` to `master` are only done for code releases. This way we always have a clean `master` that reflects the current release
* Code should be formatted using [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) style

## Testing
* First, install the test requirements (if not already installed in the virtual env with `pipenv install --dev`):
```sh
# activate environment first (optional)
$ pipenv shell

# install atoMEC as editable project in current directory (for developers)
$ pip install -e .[tests]

# alternatively install package from PyPI with test dependencies
$ pip install atoMEC[tests]
```

* To run the tests:
```sh
$ pytest --cov=atoMEC --random-order tests/
```

### Build documentation locally (for developers)

Install the prerequisites:
```sh
$ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

1. Change into `docs/` folder.
2. Run `make apidocs`.
3. Run `make html`. This creates a `_build` folder inside `docs`. You may also want to use `make html SPHINXOPTS="-W"` sometimes. This treats warnings as errors and stops the output at first occurrence of an error (useful for debugging rST syntax).
4. Open `docs/_build/html/index.html`.
5. `make clean` if required (e.g. after fixing errors) and building again.
