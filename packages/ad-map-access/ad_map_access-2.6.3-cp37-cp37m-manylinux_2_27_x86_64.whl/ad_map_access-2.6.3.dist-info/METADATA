ad-map-access provides the python binding of a C++ implementation for accessing and operating on AD map data.*ad-map-access* transfers a-priori AD map information from a standardized[OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) file format into an internalrepresentation. Optionally, the internal representation can be stored/read in a proprietary binary format.On top of the internal representation *ad-map-access* provides an API to access the map data(like road, lanes or landmarks and their semantics), perform coordinate transformations and otheroperations on geometry data. Furthermore, some higher level operations are available to performmap matching, route planning and other analysis operations required for automated driving, like e.g.right-of-way within intersections.See [project webpage](https://ad-map-access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [doxygen docu](https://ad-map-access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ad_map_access/apidoc/html/index.html) for a full interface description.
