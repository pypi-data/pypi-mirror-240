## StreetView Sampler

This project is still under construction and in an early state.

The objective is to allow for easy random sampling of googles streetview api to return a series of images from a one location or multiple locations. Ultimately this will enable users to apply image recognition techniques to generate comparisons between cities or other geographic sites.
