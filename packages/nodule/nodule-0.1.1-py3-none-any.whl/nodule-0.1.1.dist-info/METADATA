# Nodule

Convert, visualize and iterate over heterogeneous trees.

## Usage

```
Usage: nodule [OPTIONS] FORMAT PATH

  Convert file at PATH to FORMAT. Supported formats are: JSON, TOML, YAML.
  MERMAID is also supported as an output format.

  Use `import nodule.nod` to build your own conversion, visualization or
  iteration tool.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

## Out of scope

- Round trips (X -> X, X -> Y -> X) do not preserve whitespace, comments and
    layout choices.

- The built-in Mermaid visualizer may fail with duplicate node names,
    non-alphanumeric characters and other non-trivial data. Use the `nodify`
    iterator method to build a robust solution for your use-case. Similarly for
    smarter and more compact visualizations.
