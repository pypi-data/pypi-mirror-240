    This Python package provides a convenient way to execute subprocess commands either 
    consecutively or in parallel, along with logging the output. It includes features 
    for handling concurrent subprocess execution using multiprocessing.

    Features:
    - Execute subprocess commands and capture their output.
    - Log the execution of each command, including any errors.
    - Run multiple subprocess commands consecutively.
    - Run multiple subprocess commands in parallel with adjustable pool size.

    Usage:
    You can use this package to streamline the execution of subprocess commands and 
    efficiently manage their output. It's particularly useful for tasks that involve 
    running multiple external commands in a Python script.

    For usage instructions and more details, please refer to the project's documentation 
    and README.
