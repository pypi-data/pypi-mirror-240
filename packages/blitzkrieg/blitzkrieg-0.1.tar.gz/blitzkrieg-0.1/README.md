## Overview

Blitzkrieg is a comprehensive tool aimed at simplifying database operations. It offers automation, scalability, and a beautiful CLI interface. Whether you are looking to spin up a PostgreSQL or Vector database, Blitzkrieg has you covered. It even manages pgAdmin instances, all containerized via Docker and orchestrated through Kubernetes.

---

## Current Features

- **Easy Setup**: A single command deploys a fully functional PostgreSQL database, eliminating complex setup procedures and minimizing time to deployment.
- **Beautiful CLI**: Powered by Rich and Questionary, this CLI elevates your interaction with terminal operations, providing an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user experience.
- **Docker Integration**: Ensures seamless containerization of databases and pgAdmin instances, providing a consistent environment for development and production.
- **Automated Local PgAdmin Server Instance Creation**: Automatically spins up a local PgAdmin server instance with pre-configured settings, allowing for immediate web-based database management.
- **Automated Postgres Instance Creation**: Initiates and manages PostgreSQL instances with tailor-made configurations, streamlining database provisioning and ensuring optimal settings for performance.

## Upcoming Features

- **Auto-Configuration for PostgreSQL in PgAdmin**: Automate the initial setup and registration of PostgreSQL servers in the pgAdmin interface, allowing you to manage and access your servers from the get-go under the 'Servers' group in the pgAdmin UI.
- **Built-In Meta-Database**: Incorporate a self-managed meta-database that centralizes the management and orchestration of all database instances, streamlining operations and providing a unified view of system health and metrics.
- **Automated Backups**: Implement scheduled backups to safeguard your data, with restoration capabilities for resilience against data loss.
- **Kubernetes Support**: Leverage Kubernetes to facilitate automatic scaling and ensure high availability of your database instances.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming database traffic evenly across instances to maintain performance and availability.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana to provide real-time monitoring and alerting for your databases, ensuring you're always informed of their status.

## Zero-Config Automation ðŸ¤–

With Blitzkrieg's Zero-Config Automation, you don't have to worry about the nitty-gritty details of setting up databases. Here's how it can work:

### Database Details

Upon initialization, Blitzkrieg will auto-generate the database names, table schemas, and other essential details based on the project name and environmental context. This takes the guesswork out of naming conventions and schema structures, and it ensures that your database setup adheres to best practices.

### Credentials

Blitzkrieg will automatically generate secure credentials for your databases. These credentials are then encrypted and stored in a secure vault that only authorized users can access. This eliminates the need for manual password management while enhancing security.

### Kubernetes Configuration

Blitzkrieg comes with a set of best-practices templates for Kubernetes. These templates define how your databases should be orchestrated, scaled, and managed. You don't have to be a Kubernetes expert to benefit from its powerful features.

### Meta-Database

A meta-database will be auto-generated during the initialization process. This database will contain tables that help in managing the instances you deploy. Each entry will have metadata like instance name, status, health metrics, and more, allowing for easy management and monitoring.

### pgAdmin

Blitzkrieg will automatically deploy a pgAdmin instance and connect it to your PostgreSQL databases using the securely generated credentials. This means you get a fully functional, ready-to-use database management UI right out of the box.

### Application Connection

If Blitzkrieg detects a common programming language or framework in your project, it will auto-inject the necessary code snippets and environment variables to establish a database connection. This saves you the hassle of manually updating your application code to connect to the new databases.

### Scaling and Monitoring

Blitzkrieg uses sensible defaults to handle scaling and monitoring. If the system detects high resource utilization, it will automatically trigger scaling operations. Monitoring is handled via integrated support for Prometheus and Grafana, providing real-time insights into your databases' performance.

### Backups

Blitzkrieg sets up a standard backup process that runs at regular intervals. This ensures that your data is safe and that you can recover quickly in case of any mishaps.

By integrating these features into a seamless, automated process, Blitzkrieg eliminates the need for manual configuration and lets you focus on what matters most: building and scaling your applications.

## Database Support

Currently supports:

- PostgreSQL
- Vector databases (Coming Soon!)

---

## Scaling and Load Balancing

Blitzkrieg utilizes Kubernetes to automatically scale your database operations. Consult our Kubernetes guide for more details.

---

## User Flows

### Database Initialization

1. Run `blitz init` to initialize your databases and a meta-database.
2. The meta-database is created with tables to manage instances.
3. Credentials are generated and stored securely.

### Connecting Existing Codebases

1. Use `blitz connect` to connect existing codebases to a new database.
2. The command detects the programming language and injects the necessary database connection code.
3. Environment variables for the database connection are set automatically.

---

## Error Handling

Blitzkrieg employs advanced error-handling mechanisms:

- **Retry Mechanisms**: For handling transient failures.
- **Circuit Breakers**: To prevent overloading services.
- **Detailed Logs**: For effective debugging and traceability.

---

## Security

- **Vault Integration**: All sensitive data like database credentials are securely stored.
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control is implemented for all database instances.
- **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

---

## CLI Commands

- `blitz init`: Initialize your databases and a meta-database.
- `blitz connect`: Connect an existing codebase to a new database.
- `blitz deploy`: Deploy databases to a Kubernetes cluster.
- `blitz scale`: Scale your database instances up or down.
- `blitz backup`: Trigger an immediate backup of your databases.
