## What is Vision?
```
It is a web app testing framework that combines selenium and computer vision written in python.

There are several good selenium automation frameworks out there. Why then make another one? 
- Most of the better frameworks are not free for use.
- Most frameworks are selenium only.
- I needed a framework that is open source.
- I needed a framework that needs minimal coding
```
