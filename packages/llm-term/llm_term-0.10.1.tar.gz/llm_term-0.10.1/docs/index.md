## Installation

```bash
pipx install llm-term
```

## Usage

Then, you can chat with the model directly from the command line:

```shell
llm-term
```

Make sure you have an OpenAI API key set as an environment variable
(this can also set via the `--api-key` / `-k` flag in the CLI):

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Optionally, you can set a custom model. llm-term defaults
to `gpt-3.5-turbo` (this can also set via the
`--model` / `-m` flag in the CLI):

```shell
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"
```

Want to start the conversion directly from the command line? No problem,
just pass your prompt to `llm-term`:

```shell
llm-term show me python code to detect a palindrome
```

You can also set a custom system prompt. llm-term defaults to a reasonable
prompt for chatting with the model, but you can set your own prompt (this
can also set via the `--system` / `-s` flag in the CLI):

```shell
export OPENAI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE="You are a helpful assistant who talks like a pirate."
```
