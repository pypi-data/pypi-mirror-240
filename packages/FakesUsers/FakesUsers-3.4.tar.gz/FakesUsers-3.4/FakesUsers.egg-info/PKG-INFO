What commands are there in this library? This library has commands such as:
Changing the region for generation
```sh
genRegion('ru/en/de')
```
PS:If you put genRegion('ru'), then all names, numbers and addresses will be regenerated as relevant for Russia. otherwise, if you specify genRegion('en'), all names, phone numbers, and addresses will be regenerated to the US. Otherwise, if you specify genRegion('de'), all names, phone numbers and addresses will be regenerated for Germany.

Displaying a random name
```sh
fake_name('gender')
```
PS:If you write 'male' in brackets, then only male names will be generated, the opposite if you put 'female' in brackets

Displaying a random name
```sh
fake_lastname('gender')
```
PS:If you write 'male' in brackets, then only male lastnames will be generated, the opposite if you put 'female' in brackets

Displaying a random phone number
```sh
fake_number()
```

Displaying a random addres
```sh
fake_addres(True/False)

```sh
from FakesUsers import Fu

fu = Fu()
fu.genRegion('en')

print(fu.fake_name('male'))
print(fu.fake_name('female'))
print(fu.fake_city())
print(fu.fake_addres(True))
print(fu.fake_addres(False))
print(fu.fake_number())
print(fu.fake_email())
print(fu.fake_autonum())
print(fu.fake_pass())
print(fu.fake_link())
print(fu.fake_banknumber())
print(fu.fake_dob())
