## Usage

### Import

```python
import amfTools
```


## Class AMF() : 

```python
AMF(product : Object, autoconect : bool = True, portnumber : int = None, syringeVolume : int = None, productAddress : int = 1, type : str = None, serialBaudrate : int = None) 

```
Initialize the AMF object. Either serialPort, serialNumber or a Device type object must be specified as product.

### General Methods : 

```python
connect(serialBaudrate : int = defaultSerialBaudrate, serialTimeout : float = defaultSerialTimeout) -> bool
```
Connect to the product. If the connection is successful, return True, otherwise return False.

```python
disconnect() 
```
Disconnect from the product

```python
send(command : str, integer : bool = False, force_aws : bool = False) 
```
Send a command to the product. If the command is successful, return the response of the product. If integer is True, the response will be converted to an integer. If force_aws is True, the product will be temporary set to wait for an answer even if it is set to not wait for an answer.

```python
receive(integer = False, full : bool = False, isfloat : bool = False) -> str
```
Receive a line of response from the product. If integer is True, the response will be converted to an integer. If full is True, the response will be returned as is, without removing the first and last character. If float is True, the response will be converted to a float.

```python
prepareCommand(command : str, parameter : int = None) -> str
```
Prepare a command to be sent to the product. If the command needs a parameter, it must be specified. The parameter must be an integer.
