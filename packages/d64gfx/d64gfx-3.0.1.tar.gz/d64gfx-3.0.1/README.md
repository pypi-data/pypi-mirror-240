### This project (d64gfx) contains a few graphics routines associated with my Commodore 64 disk image utilities (d64py). They're used by my DiskWrangler (q.v.), and are in a separate library because they're Qt6-specific.

* getting the icon from a GEOS file as a QPixmap
* font previews (including mega-fonts) as a QPixmap
* geoPaint previews as a QPixmap
