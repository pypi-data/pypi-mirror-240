### 2. **Algorithm Specification**

Directly specify the hashing algorithm:

```bash
python alecto.py -a <algorithm> <password>
```

### 3. **Custom Salt Integration**

Elevate password security by introducing custom salts into the hashing process. Alecto seamlessly accommodates custom salts, providing users with granular control over the salting mechanism, a crucial aspect of robust password storage.

### 4. **Terminal Clarity Enhancement**

Alecto includes a terminal-clearing functionality, optimizing user experience by ensuring a clean and organized interface.

### 5. **Fine-tuned Hash Length Specification**

Specific to shake_128 and shake_256 algorithms, Alecto enables users to precisely specify the hash length using the `--hash-length` option. This advanced feature allows for tailoring hash outputs to exact requirements.

## Advanced Usage

### 1. **Parallel Salting**

For enhanced security, leverage both custom and default salts simultaneously:

```bash
python alecto.py <password> -a <algorithm> --salt --both-salt
```

### 2. **Custom Salt Usage**

Utilize a custom salt in the hashing process:

```bash
python alecto.py <password> -a <algorithm> --salt --custom-salt
```

### 3. **Custom Byte Length For SHAKE128 AND SHAKE256**

'''bash
python alecto.py <password> -a <shake128 or shake256> --hash-length <length>
'''
## Examples

### 1. **Custom Algorithm and Salt**

```bash
python alecto.py -a sha3_256 --custom-salt mypassword
```

### 2. **Parallel Salting with Shake_256**

```bash
python alecto.py -- salt --both-salt -a shake_256 --hash-length 64 mypassword
```
## Considerations

- When using a custom salt, it is seamlessly integrated into the hashing process.
- For algorithms like argon2 and bcrypt, employing a custom salt enhances overall security.
- Default salts are automatically generated when using the `--salt` or `--both-salt` options.

**Disclaimer:** Alecto is intended for educational and security research purposes. Users are advised to employ the tool responsibly and adhere to ethical guidelines.
