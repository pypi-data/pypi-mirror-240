# Hummus.py

This is an asynchronous wrapper currently in version 0.3.1!

## Getting started

Download these files and put them in a folder named "hummus". Next to the hummus folder, create your main file. You can use the following code in the main file to connect to Hummus:
```py
import hummus
from hummus.main import Client
import asyncio

class Commands(Client):
	async def test(self,ctx:hummus.message.Message):
		print(ctx.content)
		await ctx.reply(f"<@{ctx.author.id}> activated test!")

Client = Commands(prefix="!",bottoken="INSERT TOKEN HERE", status="online", game="!test")

asyncio.run(Client.RUN())
```

Adding new commands is as simple as creating new functions under the `Commands` class. Adding custom arguments is as simple as adding parameters in a function, as seen below (remember: In every function, you must have the `self` and `ctx:hummus.message.Message` args!):

```py
class Commands(Client):
	async def test(self,ctx:hummus.message.Message,test=None): #extra "test" arg
		print(test)
		print(ctx.content)
		await ctx.reply(f"<@{ctx.author.id}> activated test! Arg 1: {test}")
```

You can make these parameters have annotations (`test: str` or `mention: hummus.member.User`) or have default values (`test=None`).

## Arguments

There are 2 ways to have arguments in a Hummus.py command:
1. Add custom optional arguments to your function
2. Use `.split(" ")` to split words in a command into different items on a list

Custom arguments in a function will function differently than using `.split(" ")`. The argument system looks for quotation marks in a message, and if there is text within quotation marks, no matter if there are spaces, the entire text (within the quotations!) will be considered as a **single** argument. This allows for easier usage of commands like `!nickname` where you can specify a nickname with spaces, as long as the nickname is within quotation marks.

Quotation marks are not necessary for arguments with no spaces!

## Installation

You can do `pip install hummus2016.py` to install Hummus.py as a package, or you can import it manually by downloading the files at [the GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/lg125yt/hummus.py)

## Usage

### Commands

Hummus.py is in development, so it will not have all the functions existing. Also, please note that the Hummus API itself is unfinished and is missing endpoints, so I cannot have every function either.

Here's an example on how to use the `ctx.getUser()` function where you can get any user with their ID:

Without parameter and annotation:
```py
class Commands(Client):
	async def avatar(self,ctx:hummus.message.Message):
		if len(ctx.mentions) > 0:
			member = ctx.getUser(ctx.mentions[0].id)
			await ctx.reply(member.avatar.url)
		else:
			await ctx.reply(ctx.author.avatar.url)
```

With parameter and annotation:
```py
class Commands(Client):
	async def avatar(self,ctx:hummus.message.Message,mention:hummus.member.User=None):
		if mention: #"None" is equivalent to "False"
			member = ctx.getUser(mention.id)
			await ctx.reply(member.avatar.url)
		else:
			await ctx.reply(ctx.author.avatar.url)
```

As you can see, the above code fetches a member based on the first mention that is in the recieved command, and uses the Member object to get their avatar url.

### Moderation Commands (or commands requiring permissions)

You can get access to Hummus.py's permissions checking feature with `from hummus.funcs import fullPermsCheck`. Its arguments are the `Message` object you recieve on command, your class instance aka `self`, the permission you want to check, and **optionally,** the target user ID to compare permissions with. What the `fullPermsCheck()` function does is that it checks to see if the user has the required permission, and it also checks whether it has a higher role than the target ID when specified (permissions comparing). You would use the function like this:

```py
perms = await fullPermsCheck(ctx,self,"kick_members",ctx.mentions[0]) #assume this is in a command function
```

The code would return a `bool` object which you could use to verify that the user executing the command has the required permissions.

So, for commands that require permissions such as kicking members, the **optimal** code would be the following:

```py
class Commands(Client):
	async def kick(self,ctx:hummus.message.Message,mention:hummus.member.User=None):
		if not mention:
			await ctx.reply("Please mention a user to kick them.")
			return
		perms = await fullPermsCheck(ctx,self,"kick_members",mention)
		member = await ctx.getUser(mention)
		if perms:
			e = await member.kick()
			if e.staus_code == 200 or e.status_code == 204: #i dont remember which status code it is lol
				await ctx.reply(f"i have kicked <@{member.id}>!")
			else:
				await ctx.reply(f"Error kicking user. Status code: {e.status_code}")
		else:
			await ctx.reply(f"You do not have the perms to kick {member.user.username}!")
```

Existing moderation commands you can use:
- `member.kick()`
- `member.nick()`
- `ctx.deleteMessage()`
- `ctx.bulkDelete()`

Hummus's API is very unfinished, which means fetching a guild member with the endpoint doesn't exist, as is with many other endpoints. Therefore, Hummus.py has to rely on login information for necessary info such as role permissions. Because I am lazy and don't know how Hummus/Discord's permissions integers works, Hummus.py now uses Discord.py as a dependency (it has a needed permissions function). However, this is mainly a package process, which means you don't need to manually import Discord.py in your main bot code, you just need to have it installed.

### Events

You can use events to execute code, as demonstrated below.

```py
from hummus.events import Events

class Events(Events):
	async def on_message_create(self, message):
		if message.content.startswith("ping"):
			await message.reply("pong")
```

Make sure to put this in your main file, before your `Client` class. You will also want to "listen" for this class before running the `Client` class, as shown below:

```py
Client = Commands(prefix="!", bottoken=token, status="online", game="!test")

async def bot():
	Client.LISTEN(Events())
	Client.RUN()

asyncio.run(bot())
```

Events are a WIP, expect some bugs and a **lot** of missing events.

## Support
I am LG125YT#2241 on Hummus, @ytlg on Discord, and @lg125yt on Replit.

## Roadmap
Currently attempting to add all endpoints from the [Hummus API docs](https://hummus.sys42.net/developers/docs/intro) beginning with most important for bot development.

## Changelog

Version 0.3.3:
- Updated the README (this thingy you're reading!) to not have the wackiest indents (frick you replit)

Version 0.3.2:
- Fixed hummus.py not working when you didn't manually register an `Events` class to listen.

Version 0.3.1:
- Quick update just added `ctx.deleteMessage(id)` because i forgor to add it before :sku:

Version 0.3.0:
- More events in the `Events` class work now, also `self.allGuilds` in the `Client` class now updates on related events like guild member join/leave and guild add/remove
- `Client` class initialization redone a little, see the "Getting Started" and "Events" section in this README
- Command args should now fully work, you do not need to add a default value to parameters and some annotations (namely `str`,`int`, and `hummus.member.User`) now work
- The `Author` class has been renamed to the `User` class because most use cases within the package do not reflect the "Author" status of a user (this should not affect much of anything since annotations did not work before this update)


Too lazy to like do anything from before, if you want to do it for me, go for it.

## Contributing
Contribute if you want, you can make a pull request on the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/lg125yt/hummus.py), comment on the [Replit project.](https://replit.com/@LG125YT/Classes-or-something-ig#main.py) Note that the Replit project is the most recent version of Hummus.py, because it is where I test new features. You can see upcoming features on the Replit project if you want.
