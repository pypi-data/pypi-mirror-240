"""Saddle stitch (like in newpapers or magazines)

This schema is used in newspapers or magazines: the sheets are inserted into each other.

To use this schema (with --group=1, or without --group):

- print your imposed PDF file, two-sided;
- if there is two source pages on each destination page:
    - fold all your sheets at once;
    - otherwise, separately fold each sheet of paper, and insert them into each other;
- bind.

With option --group=3 (for instance), repeat the step above for every group of three sheets. You get several signatures, that you have to bind together to get a proper book.
