TITLE: SDoc text markup

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: SDOC-SRS-20
STATUS: Active
TITLE: SDoc markup language
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc shall implement its own markup language called S-Doc (strict-doc).
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
The most commonly used Markdown format lacks the ability to store requirements metadata. While the RST syntax does allow for customization with directives to implement metadata extensions, its visual appearance contradicts other requirements of StrictDoc, such as the type-safety of the grammar and visual readability. Therefore, a markup language tailored specifically to the needs of the requirements tool provides direct control over the capabilities implemented in both the markup and the user interface.
<<<
RELATIONS:
- TYPE: Parent
  VALUE: SDOC-SSS-33

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: SDOC-SRS-21

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: SDOC-SRS-32
TITLE: Link document nodes

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: SDOC-SRS-102
TITLE: Automatic resolution of reverse relations
STATEMENT: >>>
The StrictDoc's graph database shall maintain the requirement relations and their reverse relations as follows:

- For a Parent relation, the database shall calculate the reverse Child relation.
- For a Child relation, the database shall calculate the reverse Parent relation.
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
The calculation of the reverse relations allows the user interface code to get and display both requirement's parent and child relations.
<<<
COMMENT: >>>
Example: If a child requirement REQ-002 has a parent requirement REQ-001, the graph database first reads the link ``REQ-002 -Parent> REQ-001``, then it creates a corresponding ``REQ-001 -Child> REQ-002`` on the go. Both relations can be queried as follows, in pseudocode:

.. code-block::

    get_parent_requirements(REQ-002) == [REQ-001]
    get_children_requirements(REQ-001) == [REQ-002]
