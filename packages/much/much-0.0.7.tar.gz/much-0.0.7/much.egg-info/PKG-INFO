A simple utility for crawling text from 2ch

## Usage

The command `pull` requires two attributes - url of the web page to fetch and path to output file with `json` or `txt` extension depending on required output file format. For example:

```sh
python -m much pull https://2ch.hk/b/arch/2018-08-22/res/181770037.html assets/stories.txt
```

To fetch archived threads on `17`th page:

```sh
python -m much fetch 17
```

To list top `10` fetched threads by size (cumulative number of characters in messages longer than 100 symbols):

```sh
python -m much top 10
```

To star a thread (copy it to folder `assets/starred` with a given name):

```sh
python -m much star 263473351 discussion
```

## Installation

To install through pip:

```sh
pip install much
```

To install dependencies and create conda environment:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
