## Installation Guide

For a seamless installation of our package, which is tightly coupled with fixed versions of Python and its dependencies, we highly recommend setting up a Python virtual environment and using a version management tool. Our preferred tool for managing Python versions is [Rye](https://rye-up.com/), which offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface for this purpose.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have Rye installed on your system. If you haven't installed Rye yet, please visit [Rye's Installation Guide](https://rye-up.com/guide/publish/#publish) for detailed instructions on how to set it up.
