Welcome to LDAQ documentation!
===============================================================

This package provides an extendable interface for data acquisition and generation. It is designed to be quickly set-up, easy to use and accomodate a wide range of data sources.

The source-code for this package is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/ladisk/LDAQ>`_.

The package enables data **acquisition** and signal **generation** from multiple hardware sources, and costumizable **live data visualization**.

See :doc:`simple_start` for a quick start guide.

See :doc:`tutorials` to learn about different LDAQ features.

For more advanced use cases of currently supported hardware see notebook :doc:`examples`.

.. note::
   
   To quickly add acquisition code to your project, go to the :doc:`snippets` page, where you can copy and paste the code you need.
