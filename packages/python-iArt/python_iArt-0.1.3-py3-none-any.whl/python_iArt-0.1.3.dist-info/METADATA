## Description

iArt (Imputation-Assisted Randomization Tests) is a Python package designed for conducting finite-population-exact randomization tests in design-based causal studies with missing outcomes. It offers a robust solution to handle missing data in causal inference, leveraging the potential outcomes framework and integrating various outcome imputation algorithms.

## Installation

To install [iArt](https://pypi.org/project/python-iArt/), run the following command:

```bash
pip install python-iArt
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use iArt:

```python
import numpy as np
import iArt

Z = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
X = [[5.1, 3.5], [4.9, np.nan], [4.7, 3.2], [4.5, np.nan], [7.2, 2.3], [8.6, 3.1], [6.0, 3.6], [8.4, 3.9]]
Y = [[4.4, 0.5], [4.3, 0.7], [4.1, np.nan], [5.0, 0.4], [1.7, 0.1], [np.nan, 0.2], [1.4, np.nan], [1.7, 0.4]]
result = iArt.test(Z=Z, X=X, Y=Y, L=1000, verbose=True)
print(result)
```
Detailed usage can be found here [ReadDoc](https://iart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Features

- Conducts finite-population-exact randomization tests.
- Handles missing data in causal inference studies.
- Supports various outcome imputation algorithms.
- Offers covariate adjustment in exact randomization tests.


## Contributing

Your contributions to iArt are highly appreciated! If you're looking to contribute, we encourage you to open issues for any bugs or feature suggestions, or submit pull requests with your proposed changes. 

### Setting Up a Development Environment

To set up a development environment for contributing to iArt, follow these steps:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```
This creates a virtual environment (`venv`) for Python and activates it, allowing you to work on the package without affecting your global Python environment.
