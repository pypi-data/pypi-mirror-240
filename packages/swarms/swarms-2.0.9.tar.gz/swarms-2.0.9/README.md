## Vision
At Swarms, we're transforming the landscape of AI from siloed AI agents to a unified 'swarm' of intelligence. Through relentless iteration and the power of collective insight from our 1500+ Agora researchers, we're developing a groundbreaking framework for AI collaboration. Our mission is to catalyze a paradigm shift, advancing Humanity with the power of unified autonomous AI agent swarms.

----------

## Installation
`pip3 install --upgrade swarms`

---

## Usage
We have a small gallery of examples to run here, [for more check out the docs to build your own agent and or swarms!](https://docs.apac.ai)

### `Flow` Example
- The `Flow` is a superior iteratioin of the `LLMChain` from Langchain, our intent with `Flow` is to create the most reliable loop structure that gives the agents their "autonomy" through 3 main methods of interaction, one through user specified loops, then dynamic where the agent parses a <DONE> token, and or an interactive human input verison, or a mix of all 3. 

```python

from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.structs import Flow

api_key = ""

# Initialize the language model, this model can be swapped out with Anthropic, ETC, Huggingface Models like Mistral, ETC
llm = OpenAIChat(
    # model_name="gpt-4"
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.5,
    # max_tokens=100,
)

## Initialize the workflow
flow = Flow(
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=2,
    dashboard=True,
    # stopping_condition=None,  # You can define a stopping condition as needed.
    # loop_interval=1,
    # retry_attempts=3,
    # retry_interval=1,
    # interactive=False,  # Set to 'True' for interactive mode.
    # dynamic_temperature=False,  # Set to 'True' for dynamic temperature handling.
)

# out = flow.load_state("flow_state.json")
# temp = flow.dynamic_temperature()
# filter = flow.add_response_filter("Trump")
out = flow.run("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.")
# out = flow.validate_response(out)
# out = flow.analyze_feedback(out)
# out = flow.print_history_and_memory()
# # out = flow.save_state("flow_state.json")
# print(out)



```

------

### `SequentialWorkflow`
- Execute tasks step by step by passing in an LLM and the task description!
- Pass in flows with various LLMs
- Save and restore Workflow states!
```python
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.structs import Flow
from swarms.structs.sequential_workflow import SequentialWorkflow

# Example usage
api_key = (
    ""  # Your actual API key here
)

# Initialize the language flow
llm = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=3000,
)

# Initialize the Flow with the language flow
flow1 = Flow(llm=llm, max_loops=1, dashboard=False)

# Create another Flow for a different task
flow2 = Flow(llm=llm, max_loops=1, dashboard=False)

# Create the workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(max_loops=1)

# Add tasks to the workflow
workflow.add("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.", flow1)

# Suppose the next task takes the output of the first task as input
workflow.add("Summarize the generated blog", flow2)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run()

# Output the results
for task in workflow.tasks:
    print(f"Task: {task.description}, Result: {task.result}")

```
