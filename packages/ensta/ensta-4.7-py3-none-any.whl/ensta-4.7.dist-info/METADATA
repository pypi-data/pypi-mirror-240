This package lets you use Instagram's Internal Web API through simple functions and classes. Ensta uses Instagram's Original Web API to scrape data which makes it a reliable choice over other third-party scrapers. This library mainly focuses on Simplicity & Reliability.

Two type of classes are supported - ***Guest & Host***.

## Installation
To install this package, run the below command in a terminal window:
```shell
$ pip install ensta --upgrade
```

## Supported Actions
You can do a lot with ensta, here are some examples:

- Login using username, password or sessionid

- Change account type to public/private
- Fetch someone's posts
- Get entire data of specific post
- Like/unlike posts
- Change your biography, display name
- Get your private data like email, gender, birthday etc.

I'm doing my best to implement as many features as I can in this library. If you think a feature is missing or not working, please do raise an issue.

## 🧔🏻‍♂️ Guest Mode
This mode doesn't require login and can be used to fetch publicly available data from Instagram's Servers.

Here's an example where an instance of *Guest Class* is created to fetch [Cristiano Ronaldo's](https://www.instagram.com/cristiano/) profile information:

```python
from ensta import Guest

guest = Guest()
profile = guest.profile("cristiano")

if profile is not None:
    print(profile.biography)
    print(profile.follower_count)
    print(profile.following_count)
```

## 🧔🏻‍♂️ Host Mode
This mode requires login through *Username* & *Password*.
It can be used to take actions that require login. Additionally, users can update their own profile through this class.

Here's an example where an instance of *Host Class* is created to follow [Cristiano Ronaldo's](https://www.instagram.com/cristiano/) account:

```python
from ensta import Host

host = Host("username", "password")
status = host.follow("cristiano")

print(status)
```

### Code Samples:
1. **Fetch Followers / Followings List**
    ```python
    from ensta import Host

    host = Host("username", "password")
   
    followers = host.followers("cristiano")
    followings = host.followings("cristiano")

    for user in followers: print(user.username)
    for user in followings: print(user.username)
    ```

3. **Follow / Unfollow People**
    ```python
    from ensta import Host
    
    host = Host("username", "password")
   
    print(host.follow("cristiano"))
    print(host.unfollow("cristiano"))
    ```
