### DESCRIPTION: ##########################################################

VSDM is the Python implementation of the wavelet-harmonic integration method, designed for the efficient calculation of dark matter direct detection scattering rates in anisotropic detectors, and for arbitrary dark matter velocity distributions.

The code is still under development. Many of the components have been tested for accuracy, but no guarantee is made for the accuracy of the complete package.
