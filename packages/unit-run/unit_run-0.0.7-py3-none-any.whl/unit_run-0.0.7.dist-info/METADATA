# unit-run
## Description

This package is used to simply run a unit *(only supports the ``Callable`` object currently)* in Python **without any extra running code**. And it can also save/load all your input parameters as/from a simple json file, so it is easy to run a target unit with auto-input parameters group by give it just a group name.

## Documentation
See [document](https://lingfei-he.github.io/unit-run/doc/_build/html/intro.html)


## To do
- Support for any code segment and the classes from popular package like `numpy.ndarray`.
- Support for complete storage for `Unit` (including the target unit object).
- Maybe create a new buldled file extension named `.unit` to pack all the data files into a single file and provide graphic user interface to get access to it.
- Support for multiple languages.
