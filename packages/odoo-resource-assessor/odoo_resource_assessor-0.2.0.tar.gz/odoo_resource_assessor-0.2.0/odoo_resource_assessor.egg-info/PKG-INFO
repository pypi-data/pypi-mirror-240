Description: # Odoo Resource Assessor
        
        This tool calculates the Odoo configuration based on the available system resources. It is designed to automate the configuration process by calculating the optimal number of worker processes and memory limits for Odoo based on the server's specifications.
        
        ## Output example
        
        ```bash
        $ resource-assessor
        
        Enter the number of CPUs: 4
        Enter the amount of RAM in GB: 34
        Do you want to customize the time limits? (current: cpu=600, real=1200) [y/N]: N

        ; Odoo configuration generated by resource-assessor
        workers = 3
        cron_workers = 1
        
        ; Customize the Odoo timeouts
        limit_time_cpu = 600
        limit_time_real = 1200
        
        ; Customize the Odoo memory limits
        limit_memory_hard = 5637144576
        limit_memory_soft = 4563402752
        
        ; End of configuration generated by resource-assessor
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the Odoo Resource Assessor, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip install odoo-resource-assessor
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Interactive mode
        
        To assess the resources and get a recommended Odoo configuration, simply execute the tool. It will prompt you to enter the number of CPUs and the amount of RAM in GB:
        
        ```bash
        resource-assessor
        ```
        
        ### Automatic mode
        
        For assessing the current system automatically, use the `--self` flag to have the script determine the available system resources:
        
        ```bash
        resource-assessor --self
        ```
        
        In `--self` mode, you can pass extra flags to output specific values:
        
        ```bash
        $ resource-assessor --self --workers
        
        9
        ```
        
        Valid flags are `--workers`, `--soft`, and `--hard`.
        
        ### Output to file
        
        To write the entire generated configuration to a file, use the `--output` flag:
        
        ```bash
        resource-assessor --output odoo.conf
        ```
        
        ### Help
        
        You can check all the features by passing `--help` flag:
        
        ```bash
        $ resource-assessor --help
        
        usage: resource-assessor [options]
        
        A tool to calculate Odoo configuration based on system resources.
        
        Default values can be set using environment variables:
        - LIMIT_TIME_CPU_DEFAULT
        - LIMIT_TIME_REAL_DEFAULT
        - CRON_WORKERS_DEFAULT
        
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --cpu CPU             Number of CPUs (will prompt if not provided)
          --ram RAM             Amount of RAM in GB (will prompt if not provided)
          -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                                Output file path to write the configuration
          -s, --self            Run using the current machine's resources without prompting
          -w, --workers         Output the number of workers based on current machine's CPUs (only with --self)
          --soft                Output the calculated limit_memory_soft value (only with --self)
          --hard                Output the calculated limit_memory_hard value (only with --self)
          --limit-time-cpu <seconds>
                                Limit time CPU (default: 600)
          --limit-time-real <seconds>
                                Limit time real (default: 1200)
          --version             show program's version number and exit
        
        Example: resource-assessor --self
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        - Automatically calculates the number of HTTP workers for Odoo.
        - Determines optimal memory limits based on system's RAM.
        - Can use the current system's resources with the `--self` flag for convenience.
        - Can output the calculated values for workers and memory limits.
