# Test Notebooks
This folder contains a series of notebooks used to test the scripts.
The following list will contain the notebook names, along with what they're testing:
- `clipping_check`: iterates through the entire ApRES dataset to see if any clipping shows up
- `data_explore`: exploratory data analysis of temperatures, voltages, and chirp amplitudes
- `processing_steps`: step by step illustrated procedure for generating profiles, using examples of good and bad data
- `profile_sensitivity`: investigating how changing different parameters in the profile calculation impacts the final result
- `profiles_explore`: initial plots of the profiles calculated with default settings across the dataset
- `test_file_selection`: testing file selection and loading of .DAT files
- `testing_xapres`: testing loading in .DAT files into Xarray and plotting some data
- `vels_test`: some intitial testing of vertical velocity calculations
- `window_sensitivity`: sensitivity tests of vertical velocity calculations
