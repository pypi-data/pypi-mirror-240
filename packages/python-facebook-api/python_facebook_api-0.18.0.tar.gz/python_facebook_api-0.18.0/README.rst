============
Introduction
============

We have refactored this library after v0.10.0. If you want to use old version, please see branch ``v0``.

The new structure we will provide like follow show.

.. image:: docs/docs/images/structure.png


.. note::

    This new structure still in developing.

    Now You can use base class ``GraphApi`` to get data.

==========
Installing
==========

If you want to use old version you can set version to ``0.9.*``, And this series will also support with python2.7

You can install this library from ``pypi``::

    $pip install --upgrade python-facebook-api
    ✨🍰✨


=====
Usage
=====

--------
GraphAPI
--------

Now you can use ``GraphApi`` class to communicate with Facebook Graph Api.

You can initial ``GraphApi`` with three different methods.

1. if you already have an access token, you can initial with it::

    >>> from pyfacebook import GraphAPI
    >>> api = GraphAPI(access_token="token")

2. if you want to use app credentials to generate app token::

    >>> from pyfacebook import GraphAPI
    >>> api = GraphAPI(app_id="id", app_secret="secret", application_only_auth=True)

3. if you want to perform an authorization process to a user::

    >>> from pyfacebook import GraphAPI
    >>> api = GraphAPI(app_id="id", app_secret="secret", oauth_flow=True)
    >>> api.get_authorization_url()
    # ('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?response_type=code&client_id=id&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F&scope=public_profile&state=PyFacebook', 'PyFacebook')
    # let user to do oauth at the browser opened by link.
    # then get the response url
    >>> api.exchange_user_access_token(response="url redirected")
    # Now the api will get the user access token.

Then you can get data from facebook.

Get object data::

    >>> api.get_object(object_id="20531316728")
    >>> {'name': 'Facebook App', 'id': '20531316728'}

More you can see the code because we still working on new structure.

-----------
FacebookAPI
-----------

Initial methods same with ``GraphAPI``.

Get user data::

    >>> fb.user.get_info(user_id="413140042878187")
    >>> User(id='413140042878187', name='Kun Liu')

Get page data::

    >>> fb.page.get_info(page_id="20531316728")
    >>> Page(id='20531316728', name='Facebook App')
