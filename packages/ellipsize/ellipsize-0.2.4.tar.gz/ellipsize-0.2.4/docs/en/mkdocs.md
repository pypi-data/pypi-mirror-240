# MkDocs

Also, this serves as axample of multi-language [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) project.
I honestly tried to make it as in https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/2346
but failed.

So this is just two separate MkDocs projects in one repo, for two languages.
And you can debug them locally with `make serve-ru` and `make serve`.
