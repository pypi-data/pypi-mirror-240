# Ellipsize with style

Refining large Python objects significantly for appealing visualization is handy,
especially for managing AWS outputs and similar tasks.

Additionally, it prevents you from accidentally printing megabytes of text.

???+ optional-class "config ellipsized with ellipsize(config, max_items_to_show=1, max_item_length=16)"
    ```python

    ```json
    --8<-- "example.json"
    ```
