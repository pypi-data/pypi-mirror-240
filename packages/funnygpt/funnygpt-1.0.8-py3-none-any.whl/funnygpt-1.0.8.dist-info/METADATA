# [Python Package: Foo Barstein](https://pypi.org/project/funnygpt/1.0.6/)
#### What is this package?
This package was created so you can have Professor Foo Barstein talk with you straight from your terminal. Professor Barstein can do four things - tell you a joke, tell you a haiku, tell you a compliment, and write you an email. Professor Barstein is a fictional character and powered by GPT-3.

### Features
1. gptchat: will take the role of Professor Foo Barstein and use ChatGPT to generate a joke, haiku, compliment, or an email so you don't have to be lonely in your terminal anymore. 

2. cowtalk: will take the response from ChatGPT-3 and add "moo" every 3 words so you can talk with cows!
  
3. onewordperline: onewordperline will play around with how the text is displayed. Instead of left to right, you will be reading from top to bottom. 

4. changepreset: changepreset will change how ChatGPT answers your question. Use this function to give ChatGPT a different role than Professor Foo Barstein!
