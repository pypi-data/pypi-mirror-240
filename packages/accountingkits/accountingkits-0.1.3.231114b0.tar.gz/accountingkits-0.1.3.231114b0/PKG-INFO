# Accounting Kits

**Recommend CONDA manage the dependencies.**

This is a self-made package which target is help to deal with different problems in accounting research.


**WARNING: This version is Still PREVIEW and UNSTABLE! 
ANY functions and classes COULD BE CHANGED (NAMES OR OTHERS) IN  FUTURE!**

## 1. Setup the package:

I recommend to install the package by conda-forge, or may cause error:

In rolling version(How ever the package itself would be stop from have dependencies),
because I use conda to manage my package, but pip always try to corrupt my environment.

This make me could not put these following dependencies in setup.cfg, 
If there found any method to help me to manage the environment while could help you with dependencies,
feel free to tell me, it is the first time for me to write the python package, thank you.

Here are Conda install packages:
```
certifi
numpy
pandas
pathos
requests
python-Levenshtein
thefuzz
rapidfuzz
sas7bdat
nltk
beautifulsoup4
fake-useragent
Cython
wordninja
```

You may install these special dependencies from pip only:
```
ratelimit
backoff
```
Check that some of other pack are recommend but not need:
```
selenium (pip)
```

then clone->install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/qihangZH/accountingkits.git
cd accountingkits
pip install .
```

If developing need:

```shell
#IF DEVELOPING
python setup.py develop
```

## 2. How if  I need to use the single module But I find it use other modules?

Nice question, If really so, you may have to replace the code for single modules sometimes only uses some _BasicFuncs functions.

For example in FuzzyMatchT.py:

```python
from .. import _BasicTools
```

To search in FuzzyMatch.py,you can find that, "_BasicFunc" result contains:

```python
with pathos.multiprocessing.Pool(
        # for safer exception in multiprocess
        initializer=_BasicFunc.MultiprocessF.processes_interrupt_initiator
) as pool:
    ...
```

And the only function could be found:

```python
def threads_interrupt_initiator():
    """
    Each pool process will execute this as part of its
    initialization.
    Use this to keep safe for multiprocessing...and gracefully interrupt by keyboard
    """
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_IGN)
```

To replace it, you can directly put it in your need module and add some your own codes, **however, I could not premise the _BasicFunc will not be refactored in future version.** 

```python
# copy here
def threads_interrupt_initiator():
    """
    Each pool process will execute this as part of its
    initialization.
    Use this to keep safe for multiprocessing...and gracefully interrupt by keyboard
    """
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_IGN)

with pathos.multiprocessing.Pool(
                # for safer exception in multiprocess
                initializer=threads_interrupt_initiator
        ) as pool:
    ...
    
```

## 3. Deprecation and Future Warnings
**Any changes which cause Deprecation and Future Warnings will be placed here, mostly they cause version error.**

**If not, kindly send me email and I will show it in README.**

**However, Deprecation and Future warnings are unavailable for Preview/alpha/beta version**
