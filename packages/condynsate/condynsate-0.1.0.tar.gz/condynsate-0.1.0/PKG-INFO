## Description

 [condynsate](https://github.com/GrayKS3248/condynsate) is a dynamic system simulation and visualization tool built with [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) and [MeshCat](https://github.com/meshcat-dev/meshcat-python). It automatically simulates multiple objects and their interactions as described by [.urdf](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf), [.stl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)), and [.obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) files and can render real time visualizations in a web browser.

## Installation

From source:

```
python -m pip install condynsate
```

## Usage

For examples of usage, see [examples](https://github.com/GrayKS3248/condynsate/tree/main/examples).
