To store and search over unstructured data, a widely adopted approach is embedding data into vectors, stored and indexed in vector databases. The promptflow-vectordb SDK is designed for PromptFlow, provides essential tools for vector similarity search within popular vector databases, including  FAISS, Qdrant, Azure Congnitive Search, and more.
