# RF-Track

RF-Track is a novel tracking code developed at CERN for optimizing
photoinjectors, positron sources, or low-energy ion linacs in the
presence of space-charge effects. RF-Track features great flexibility
and rapid simulation speed. It can transport beams of particles with
arbitrary mass and charge, even mixed, solving fully relativistic
equations of motion.

It implements direct space-charge effects in a physically consistent
manner using parallel algorithms. It can simulate bunched and
continuous beams and transport through conventional elements and maps
of oscillating radio-frequency fields.

RF-Track is written in optimized and parallel C++, and it uses the
scripting languages Octave and Python as user interfaces.
