# MPOSE2021
#### A Dataset for Short-time Pose-based Human Action Recognition

This repository contains the MPOSE2021 Dataset for short-time pose-based Human Action Recognition (HAR). 

MPOSE2021 is developed as an evolution of the MPOSE Dataset [1-3]. It is made by human pose data detected by 
[OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) [4], [Posenet](https://github.com/google-coral/project-posenet) [11], and [Movenet](https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral/blob/master/examples/movenet_pose_estimation.py) on popular datasets for HAR, i.e. Weizmann [5], i3DPost [6], IXMAS [7], KTH [8], UTKinetic-Action3D (RGB only) [9] and UTD-MHAD (RGB only) [10], alongside original video datasets, i.e. ISLD and ISLD-Additional-Sequences [1].
Since these datasets have heterogenous action labels, each dataset labels are remapped to a common and homogeneous list of 20 actions.

This repository allows users to generate pose data for MPOSE2021 in a python-friendly format. 
Generated sequences have a number of frames between 20 and 30. 
Sequences are obtained by cutting the so-called Precursor videos (from the above-mentioned datasets), with non-overlapping sliding windows.
Frames where OpenPose/PoseNet/MoveNet cannot detect any subject are automatically discarded. Resulting samples contain one subject at a time, performing a fraction of a single action. Overall, MPOSE2021 contains 15429 samples, divided into 20 actions, performed by 100 subjects. 

Below, the steps to install the ```mpose``` library and obtain sequences are explained. Source code can be found in the [MPOSE2021 repository](https://github.com/PIC4SeRCentre/MPOSE2021_Dataset).

### Installation

Install MPOSE2021 as python package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mpose)
```
pip install mpose
```

### Getting Started

```python
# import package
import mpose

# initialize and download data
dataset = mpose.MPOSE(pose_extractor='openpose', 
                      split=1, # 1, 2, 3
                      preprocess=None, # scale_and_center, scale_to_unit
                      config_file=None, # specify custom configuration (debug)
                      velocities=False, # if True, computes additional veocity channels
                      remove_zip=False, # if True, removes zip files after extraction
                      overwrite=False, # if True, overwrites old zip files
                      verbose=True)

# print data info 
dataset.get_info()

# get data samples (as numpy arrays)
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = dataset.get_data()
```

### Class methods

* `transform(fn=None, target='X')`: apply custom transformation function to the data.
  * `fn`: the function (fn(X) or fn(y))
  * `target`: the data target (X or y)
    
* `reduce_keypoints()`: reduce the number of keypoints grouping head and feet landmarks [1]
    
* `scale_and_center()`: center poses and resize to a common scale [1]

* `scale_to_unit()`: rescale all pose data between 0 and 1

* `add_velocities(overwrite=False)`: compute keypoint velocities and add them as new channels
  * `overwrite`: if True, recomputes velocities even if already present

* `remove_velocities()`: remove velocity channels (if present)

* `remove_confidence()`: remove confidence channel (if present)

* `flatten_features()`: flatten (keypoints,channels) dimensions

* `reduce_labels()`: map labels to a smaller set of actions (e.g. to realize small demos)

* `reset_data()`: restore original data

* `get_dataset(seq_id=False)`: get data samples (as numpy arrays)
  * `seq_id`: if True, returns also the lists of sample IDs correspondent to X_train and X_test
    
* `get_info()`: print a summary of dataset statistics
        
* `get_labels()`: get the list of action labels
