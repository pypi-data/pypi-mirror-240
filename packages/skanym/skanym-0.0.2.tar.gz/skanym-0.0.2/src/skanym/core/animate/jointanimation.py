class JointAnimation:
    """Class to store a joint's animation curves.

    It contains the animation curves for the position and orientation of the joint.
    As well as the time warp curve.

    The time warp curve is a curve that can be used to control the speed of the animation
    as a function of time.
    It contains keys with a single float as value called timekeys.
    - The time of the timekey is the real time of the animation.
    - The value of the timekey is the time at which the translation and rotation curves are evaluated.

    let :math:`R(t)` the result of evaluating the rotation curve at time :math:`t` and
    :math:`f(t)` the result of evaluating the time warp curve at time :math:`t`.

    Then the effective rotation of the joint at time :math:`t` is:
    :math:`R(f(t))`
    in other words, the rotation of the joint at time :math:`t` is the result of evaluating the rotation curve at :math:`f(t)`
    This works similarly for translations.

    The logic for time warping is applied in the get_local_transform method.

    Examples
    -------
    # A translation curve that goes from [0,0,0] to [1,1,1] at time 0 and 1 respectively.
    >>> translation_curve = Curve(
    >>>     [Key(time=0., value=[0,0,0]),
    >>>     Key(time=1., value=[1,1,1])]
    >>> )

    # A default time warp curve. The value of the key at time 0 is 0 and the value of the key at time 1 is 1.
    >>> timewarp_curve = Curve(
    >>>    [Key(time=0., value=0.),
    >>>    Key(time=1., value=1.)]
    >>> )

    # A JointAnimation object with the above curves.
    >>> joint_animation = JointAnimation(
    >>>     joint=Joint(),
    >>>     translation_curve=translation_curve,
    >>>     rotation_curve=Curve(),
    >>>     timewarp_curve=timewarp_curve
    >>> )
    # let us see the result of the get_local_transform method at different times using linear interpolation.
    >>> for t in [0., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.]:
    >>>    print(joint_animation.get_local_transform(t, 'linear').pos)
    [0,0,0]
    [0.25,0.25,0.25]
    [0.5,0.5,0.5]
    [0.75,0.75,0.75]
    [1,1,1]

    # Now if we add a key to the time warp curve...
    # Adding a time key at time 0.5 with value 0.2.
    >>> joint_animation.timewarp_curve.set_key_at(time=0.5, value=0.2)
    >>> # or joint_animation.timewarp_curve.add_key(Key(time=0.5, value=0.2))
    # This means that at time 0.5 of the animation, the translation and rotation curves are evaluated at time 0.2.
    >>> for t in [0., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.]:
    >>>    print(joint_animation.get_local_transform(t, 'linear').pos)
    [0,0,0]
    [0.1,0.1,0.1]
    [0.2,0.2,0.2]
    [0.6,0.6,0.6]
    [1,1,1]
    # As we can see, the addition of this timekey causes the animation to start slow and speed up from t = 0.5.
    # In other words, 20% of the animation is performed in the first half of the animation and
    # the other 80% of the animation is performed in the second half of the animation.

        joint : Joint
            The joint that is animated.
        translation_curve : Curve, optional
            The animation curve on the position of the joint. By default, an empty curve is used.
        rotation_curve : Curve, optional
            The animation curve on the orientation of the joint. By default, an empty curve is used.
        timewarp_curve : Curve, optional
            The time warp curve to apply to the animation. By default, a curve with a start key

        Notes
        ----
        A time warp curve must contain a start and end key. The start key must have time 0 and the end key must have time 1.

        Similarly, if no end key is found, a end key is added with time 1 and value 1.

        Notes
        -----
        If the translation curve is empty, the behavior of this method changes whether
        the joint is a root joint or not. If the joint is a root joint, the translation
        is set to its local bind transform's position and if the joint is not a root joint,
        the translation is set to [0,0,0].
        Similarly, if the rotation curve is empty, the behavior of this method changes whether
        the joint is a root joint or not. If the joint is a root joint, the rotation is set to its
        local bind transform's orientation and if the joint is not a root joint, the rotation is set
        to the identity quaternion (1,0,0,0).
        If the timewarp curve is empty, this method behaves the same way as with a default timewarp curve.
