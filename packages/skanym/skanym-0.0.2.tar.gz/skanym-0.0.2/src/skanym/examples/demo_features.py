"""
This program demonstrates the creation of a new skeletal animation
based on existing ones.

The starting animations are a walk and a death animation.
The goal is to create a new animation of a character walking and
then suddenly dying. The resulting animation through the uss of
blending, cropping, merging and translating existing animations.

# We are now ready to blend the walk and death animations
