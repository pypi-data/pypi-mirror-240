# Currency Extractor EasyOCR

Currency Extractor EasyOCR is a Python package that leverages the EasyOCR library to detect currency symbols in images. This package provides a convenient command-line interface for easy integration into your projects.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install currency_extractor_easyocr
```

## Usage

### Command-line Interface

```bash
currency_symbol_extract <image_path> [--symbols SYMBOLS [SYMBOLS ...]] [--languages LANGUAGES [LANGUAGES ...]] [--image_rescale IMAGE_RESCALE]
```

#### Parameters:

- `image_path`: Path to the input image.
- `--symbols`: List of currency symbols to detect. Default is `['$', '€', '£', '¥', '₹','د.ك','₣','AED', 'INR','USD','CAD']`.
- `--languages`: List of OCR languages. Default is `['en', 'ar']`.
- `--image_rescale`: Rescale factor for the image size. Default is `50`.

#### Example:

```bash
currency_symbol_extract path/to/your/image.jpg --symbols $ € £ --languages en
```

### Dependencies

- `opencv-python`: OpenCV library for image processing.
- `easyocr`: EasyOCR library for Optical Character Recognition.

## How it Works

The package utilizes EasyOCR to read text from the input image. It then searches for currency symbols in the recognized text and returns the detected symbols.
