"""Final classes and methods at runtime.

This module provides a decorator interface to declare final
classes and methods.

This module is inspired by and is compatible with `typing.final`.
See PEP-591 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0591) for more
details on this topic.

The main component of this module is the `final` decorator that
can be used to decorate classes and methods inside a class. As
such:

- Classes decorated with @final cannot be subclassed.
- Methods decorated with @final cannot be overriden in subclasses.

For more details, see: https://runtime-final.readthedocs.io

        """A decorator that declares a class or method as final.

        A class declared as final with this decorator cannot
        be subclassed by other classes. Similarly, when methods
        of a class are declared as final, The subclasses cannot
        override them.

        Trying to subclass final classes or overriding final
        methods will raise :exc:`RuntimeError`.

        Here is an example of final classes::

            @final
            class User:
                pass

            # The following line will raise RuntimeError
            class SpecialUser(User):
                pass

        And final methods::

            class User:
                @final
                def delete(self):
                    pass

            class SpecialUser(User):
                # The following line will raise RuntimeError
                def delete(self):
                    pass

        .. note::

            When using this decorator with special attributes such as :func:`staticmethod`,
            :func:`classmethod` and :func:`property`, This decorator should be placed
            *above* the relevant decorator for that special attribute.

            E.g::

                # Correct:
                @final
                @property
                def foo(self):
                    ...

                # Wrong:
                @property
                @final
                def foo(self):
                    ...

        This decorator is also fully compatible with the :func:`typing.final`.
        In applications where type checkers need to understand the usage of
        final decorator, the ``typing.TYPE_CHECKING`` constant can be used::

            from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

            if TYPE_CHECKING:
                # Type checkers will consider this clause but
                # this will not execute at runtime.
                from typing import final
            else:
                # Type checkers will ignore this clause but
                # this is always executed at runtime.
                from runtime_final import final
        """
