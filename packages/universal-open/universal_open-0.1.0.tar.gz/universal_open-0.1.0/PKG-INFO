# Universal-Open (`uopen`)

**`uopen`** is a cross-platform utility that serves as an alternative to platform-specific commands like `xdg-open`
on Linux, `open` on macOS, and `start` on Windows. It is designed to provide a unified entry point on any of those platforms,
promoting interoperability for configuration files and scripts.

**`uopen`** just acts as a named pass-through shim, offering a common entry point for various platforms. 
However, it is important to note that using platform-specific flags with **`uopen`** is not recommended.
