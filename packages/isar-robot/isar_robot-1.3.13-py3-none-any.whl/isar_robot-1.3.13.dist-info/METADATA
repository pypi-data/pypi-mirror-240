# isar-robot

[ISAR](https://github.com/equinor/isar) - Integration and Supervisory control of Autonomous Robots - is a tool for integrating robot applications into Equinor systems. Through the ISAR API you can send command to a robot to do missions and collect results from the missions.

Running the full ISAR system requires an installation of a robot which satisfies the required [interface](https://github.com/equinor/isar/blob/main/src/robot_interface/robot_interface.py). isar-robot is a default implementation of such a robot.

# Installation

For installation of isar-robot to use with ISAR, please follow the robot integration [installation guide](https://github.com/equinor/isar#robot-integration).

# Run isar-robot

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/isar-robot
cd isar-robot
pip install -e .[dev]
```

# Contributing

We welcome all kinds of contributions, including code, bug reports, issues, feature requests, and documentation.
