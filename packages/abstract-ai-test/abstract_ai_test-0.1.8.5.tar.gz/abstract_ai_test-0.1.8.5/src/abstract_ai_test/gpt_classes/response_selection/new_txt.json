{"api_response": "The space station in outer orbit could pose a risk to satellites in lower Earth orbit through a cascading effect known as the Kessler Syndrome. This is when the concentration of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) is high enough that one collision could create a cascade, each creating fatelits that further increase the risk of more collisions. Stations, satellites or debris from the outer orbit can deteriorate over time and their orbits can decay, causing them to fall into lower orbits. If such a situation occurs, the probability of collisions in LEO could increase.", "suggestions": "Consider clarifying the presence of various orbits and the physics behind satellite collisions.", "generate_title": "Potential Risks of Objects in Outer and Lower Earth Orbit"}
