A Python module for interacting with the RiotClient local api.

## Features

- Automated lockfile grabbing
- Request method
- Riot auth

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is through `pip` but if you know better use the package manager that you want.

```sh
pip install ValLocal
```

## Reference

### Basic structure

ValLib contains this basic building blocks:

- `LockFile` a dataclass containing the lockfile data

And the following methods:

- `get_lockfile` to get the lockfile as a `LockFile` instance
- `local_api` to make requests to the RiotClient, using `LockFile`
- `local_auth` to get riot auth, using `LockFile`

### Ussage

```python
import ValLocal

lock = ValLocal.get_lockfile()
api_help = ValLocal.local_api(lock, "GET", "/help").text
print(api_help)
```

### Auth

Getting auth for remote endpoints

```python
import ValLocal

lock = ValLocal.get_lockfile()
auth = ValLocal.local_auth(lock)
```

This is the same auth as [ValLib](https://github.com/ValUtils/ValLib) ExtraAuth and it can be used both in [ValLib](https://github.com/ValUtils/ValLib) api and [ValWrap](https://github.com/ValUtils/ValWrap) endpoints.
