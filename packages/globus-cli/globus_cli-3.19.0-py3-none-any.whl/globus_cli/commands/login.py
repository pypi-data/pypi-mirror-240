    Get credentials for the Globus CLI.

    Necessary before any Globus CLI commands which require authentication will work.

    This command directs you to the page necessary to permit the Globus CLI to make API
    calls for you, and gets the OAuth2 tokens needed to use those permissions.

    The default login method opens your browser to the Globus CLI's authorization
    page, where you can read and consent to the permissions required to use the
    Globus CLI. The CLI then takes care of getting the credentials through a
    local server.

    You can use the GLOBUS_PROFILE environment variable to switch between separate
    accounts without having to log out. If this variable is not set, logging in uses a
    default profile. See the docs for details:

    https://docs.globus.org/cli/environment_variables/#profile_switching_with_globus_profile

    If the CLI detects you are on a remote session, or the --no-local-server option is
    used, the CLI will instead print a link for you to manually follow to the Globus
    CLI's authorization page. After consenting you will then need to copy and paste the
    given access code from the web to the CLI.
