# damsextractor
A privacy policy extraction tool made for the UMBC DAMS Laboratory.  
The primary goal is to use this for privacy policy text extraction in a 
web scraping environement.

When passed a valid url, the module will return a sanitized privacy policy.  
There is also an option to return a tokenized privacy policy for NLP contexts.
