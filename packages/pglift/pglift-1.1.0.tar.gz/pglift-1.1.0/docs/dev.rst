Setup
~~~~~

Clone the git repository:

::

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/dalibo/pglift.git
    $ cd pglift

Then, create a Python3 virtualenv and install the project:

::

    $ python3 -m venv .venv --upgrade-deps
    $ . .venv/bin/activate
    (.venv) $ pip install -e ".[dev]"

Though not required, tox_ can be used to run all checks (lint, tests, etc.)
needed in development environment.

.. _tox: https://tox.wiki/

Linting, formatting, type-checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project uses flake8_ for linting, black_ and isort_ for formatting and
mypy_ for type-checking.

All these checks can be run with ``tox -e lint`` or individually.

.. _flake8: https://flake8.pycqa.org/
.. _black: https://black.readthedocs.io/
.. _isort: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/
.. _mypy: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test suite can be run either directly:

::

    (.venv) $ pytest

or through ``tox``:

::

    $ tox [-e tests-doctest|tests-unit|tests-func|tests-expect]

The test suite is quite extensive and can take long to run. It is split into
*functional* tests and more *unit* ones (including *doctests*), the former
require a real PostgreSQL instance (which will be set up automatically) while
the latter do not. Each test suite gets a dedicated tox environment:
``tests-doctest``, ``tests-unit``, ``tests-func`` and ``tests-expect``.

When working on a simple fix or change that would be covered by non-functional
tests, one can run the following part of the test suite quickly:

::

    (.venv) $ pytest src tests/unit

or through ``tox``:

::

    $ tox -e tests-doctest -e tests-unit

Some unit tests use local files (in ``test/data``) to compare actual results
with their expectation. Often, when there is a mismatch that is intentional
(e.g. if interface models changed), it's handy to write back expected files:
for this, pass ``--write-changes`` option to pytest invocation.

By default, functional tests will not use systemd as a service manager /
scheduler. In order to run tests with systemd, pass the ``--systemd`` option
to pytest command.

Still in functional tests, the PostgreSQL environment would be guessed by
inspecting the system to look for PostgreSQL binaries for the most recent
version available. If multiple versions of PostgreSQL are available, a
specific version can be selected by passing ``--pg-version=<version>`` option
to the ``pytest`` command. Likewise, the ``--pg-auth`` option can be used to
run tests with specified authentication method.

"Expect" tests (in ``t`` directory) should be run with `Prysk
<https://www.prysk.net/>`_, not pytest.

If your system uses a specific locale and your tests are failing because of
assertion issues with translated messages, you can run the tests with
`LANG=C`.

.. note::

    Tests automatically run in the regular CI don't use the systemd because of
    technical limitations. However developers (with appropriate permissions)
    can launch CI jobs using the sourcehut builds service. Job manifests
    available in the ``.builds`` directory will be run any time commits are
    pushed to the ``git.sr.ht/~dalibo/pglift`` repository.

Pre-commit hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some checks (linting, typing, syntax checking, …) can be done for you
before git commits.

You just need to install the pre-commit hooks:

::

    (.venv) $ pre-commit install

Working on documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the documentation in HTML format, run:

::

    (.venv) $ make -C docs html

and open ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` to browse the result.

Alternatively, keep the following command running:

::

    (.venv) $ make -C docs serve

to get the documentation rebuilt and along with a live-reloaded Web browser.

Contributing changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make sure that lint, typing checks pass as well as at least unit tests.
* If needed, create a news fragment using ``towncrier create <id>.<type>.rst
  [--edit]`` where ``<id>`` is a short description of changes and ``<type>``
  describes the type of changes, within: ``feature``, ``bugfix``, ``removal``,
  ``doc`` or ``misc``.
* When committing changes with git, write one commit per logical change and
  try to follow pre-existing style and write a meaningful commit message (see
  https://commit.style/ for a quick guide).

Release workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preparation
+++++++++++

Prior to releasing, first, Ansible doc fragments should be copied to the
Ansible collection. Assuming a checkout of the Ansible collection is available
in parent directory, this is done through:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp tests/data/ansible-doc-fragments/*.json ../pglift-ansible/plugins/doc_fragments/

and then committing the result.

Second, the dependencies for building pglift's binary with PyOxidizer need to
be pinned and compiled. This is done by:

* running ``tox -e pin``,
* if ``pyoxidizer/requirements.txt`` changed, committing the result and
  creating a merge request in which the ``buildbin`` job would run (along
  with, possibly, ``tests-binary`` ones),
* then proceeding with next steps after merge.

Release
+++++++

Assuming we're releasing version `1.2.3`, the following steps should be
followed:

* Build the changelog

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ towncrier build --version=1.2.3
    $ git commit -m "Prepare version 1.2.3"

* Create an *annotated* git tag following the ``v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>``
  pattern.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git tag v1.2.3 -a [-s] -m 'pglift v1.2.3' --edit

  then edit the tag message to include a changelog since latest release (as
  built in the previous step).

* Push the tag to the main (upstream) repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git push --follow-tags

* Finally, the CI will build and upload the Python package to `PyPI
  <https://pypi.org/project/pglift>`_.
