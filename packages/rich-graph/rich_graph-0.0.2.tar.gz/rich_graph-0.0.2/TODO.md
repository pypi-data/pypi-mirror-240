# TODO...

### A running backlog of improvements to make.

### In priority order (queued for implementation)

1. Complete implemention of core traveral algorithms (Bredth- and Depth-First)
2. Implent tests of data structures (Nodes, Edges, and Graphs)
3. Implement tests of traversal algorithms
4. Publish to PyPi
5. Convert TODO items into Github project issues.

### In no particular order (implement as opportunity or interest allows)

- Add support for enforcing type of node and edge values
- Add both repr (code to reproduce) and str (graphical/ascii) methods to display Graph, Node, and Edge in repl.
- Consider adding seperate "as_ascii" methods to Graph, Node, and Edge classes.
- Consider adding a Graph class method to create a graph from a list of edges.
- Consider adding a Graph class method to create a graph from a list of nodes.
- Add Bellman-Ford traversal algorithm
- Add Prim minimum spanning tree traversal algorithm
- Add Krusal's minimum spanning tree traversal algorithm
- Add A\* ("A star") traversal algorithm
