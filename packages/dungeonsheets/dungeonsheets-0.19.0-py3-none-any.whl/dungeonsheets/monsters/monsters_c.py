      sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's control,
      provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried.
      
      Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance
      to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When
      the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain

      the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it looks like one of
      the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature

      relies on senses other than sight.

    Innate Spellcasting.
      The couatl's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It
      can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal
      components:
      
  
      
      At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect thoughts
      
      3/day each: bless, create food and water, cure wounds, lesser
      restoration, protection from poison, sanctuary, shield
      
      1/day each: dream, greater restoration, scrying
    Magic Weapons.
      The couatl's weapon attacks are magical.
    Shielded Mind.
      The couatl is immune to scrying and to any effect that would sense its
      emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its location.

    # Actions

    Bite.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d6
      + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13
      Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this
      poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an
      action to shake the target awake.
    Constrict.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller
      creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is
      grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is
      restrained, and the couatl can't constrict another target.
    Change Shape.
      The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a
      challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true
      form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
      wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl's
      choice).
      
      In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to
      speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other
      actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any
      statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
      and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new
      form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.
