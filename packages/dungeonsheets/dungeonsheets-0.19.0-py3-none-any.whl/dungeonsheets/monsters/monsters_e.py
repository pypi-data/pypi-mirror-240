class Efreeti(Monster):
    """

    Elemental Demise.
      If the efreeti dies, its body disintegrates in a flash of fire and
      puff of smoke, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or
      carrying.
    Innate Spellcasting.
      The efreeti's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
      15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following
      spells, requiring no material components:
      
  
      
      At will: detect magic
      
      3/day: enlarge/reduce, tongues
      
      1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form,
      invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire
    Variant: Genie Powers.
      Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few
      have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or
      the nature of reality.
      
  
      
      Disguises.
      
      Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly
      shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self
      spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that
      spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three
      times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such
      genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the
      spell on other creatures and objects as well.
      
      Wishes.
      
      The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the
      most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A
      particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to
      a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of
      wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1
      year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its
      limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's
      existence.
      
      To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a
      desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the
      creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's
      nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by
      exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is
      usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.
