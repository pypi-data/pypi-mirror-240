    Crush.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6

      the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on
      the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's head, and the

      moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long

      concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness,
      and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness
      overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or
      lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

    Elemental Demise.
      If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving

    Innate Spellcasting.
      The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC

      1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, gaseous
      form, invisibility, major image, plane shift
    Variant: Genie Powers.
      Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few
      have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or
      the nature of reality.
      
  
      
      Disguises.
      
      Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly
      shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self
      spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that
      spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three
      times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such
      genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the
      spell on other creatures and objects as well.
      
      Wishes.
      
      The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the
      most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A
      particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to
      a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of
      wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1
      year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its
      limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's
      existence.
      
      To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a
      desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the
      creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's
      nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by
      exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is
      usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.

      Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6

      (djinni's choice).
    Create Whirlwind.
      A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms
      on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind
      lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if
      concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the
      whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be
      restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as
      an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The
      whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.
      
      A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
      whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.
      If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves
      to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
