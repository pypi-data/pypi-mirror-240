      The balor makes two attacks: one with its longsword and one with its
      whip.
    Longsword.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21
      (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If the balor
      scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of
      twice.

    Teleport.
      The balor magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing

    Variant: Summon Demon.
      The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

      1d4 glabrezus, 1d3 nalfeshnees, 1d2 mariliths, or one goristro.

      until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

      to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end
