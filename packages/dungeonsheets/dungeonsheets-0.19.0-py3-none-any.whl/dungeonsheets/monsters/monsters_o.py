      until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target
      must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5
      (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target
      dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction
      to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.
