      magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her
      general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a
      bonus action to end it or if she dies.

      inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but
      someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature
      must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a
      DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is
      disguised.

      - Cantrips (at will): acid splash, blade ward, light, mending, mold earth*

      can also expend a spell slot to deal extra damage, dealing 2d8

      for each level of the slot above 1st.
    
    Stonemelders are spellcasters who gain their power from Ogrémoch,
    using elemental earth magic to sheathe their bodies in carapaces
    of rock. They are elite champions of the cult and answer only to
    the cult leaders. Not even the Black Earth priests tell
    stonemelders what to do.
    
    Each stonemelder carries a weapon known as a Black Earth rod. Such
    a rod is like an ordinary mace, but in the hands of a stonemelder,
    it serves as a conduit for Ogrémoch's wrath.
