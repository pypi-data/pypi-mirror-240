class IceDevil(Monster):
    """

    Devil's Sight.
      Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.
    Magic Resistance.
      The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
      magical effects.

    # Actions

    Multiattack.
      The devil makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claws,
      and one with its tail.
    Bite.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6
      + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.
    Claws.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4
      + 5) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.
    Tail.
      Melee Weapon Attack:+10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6
      + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.
    Wall of Ice.
      The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it
      can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30
      feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet
      in diameter.
      
      When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it
      by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to
      end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then
      makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
      
      The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or
      dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has
      AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to
      acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is
      destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the
      wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid
      air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17
      Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed
      save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air
      dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

class IceMephit(Monster):
    """

    Death Burst.
      When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of jagged ice. Each
      creature within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw,
      taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one.
    False Appearance.
      While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an
      ordinary shard of ice.
    Innate Spellcasting.
      The mephit can innately cast fog cloud, requiring no material
      components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

    # Actions

    Claws.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d4
      + 1) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) cold damage.
    Frost Breath (Recharge 6).
      The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of cold air. Each creature in that
      area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (2d4)
      cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.
    Variant: Summon Mephits.
      The mephit has a 25 percent chance of summoning 1d4 mephits of its
      kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet
      of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon
      other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies,
      or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

class Imp(Monster):
    """

    Shapechanger.
      The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that
      resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or a
      spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its
      statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes
      noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It
      reverts to its true form if it dies.
    Devil's Sight.
      Magical darkness doesn't impede the imp's darkvision.
    Magic Resistance.
      The imp has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
      magical effects.
    Variant: Familiar.
      The imp can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic
      bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can
      sense what the quasit senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each
      other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the master
      shares the quasit's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any
      reason, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the
      telepathic bond.

    # Actions

    Sting (Bite in Beast Form).
      Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4
      + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make on a DC 11 Constitution
      saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half
      as much damage on a successful one.
    Invisibility.
      The imp magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its
      concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the
      imp wears or carries is invisible with it.
