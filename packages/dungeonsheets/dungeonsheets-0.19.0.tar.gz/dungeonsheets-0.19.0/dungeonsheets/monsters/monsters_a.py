class Aboleth(Monster):
    """Amphibious.
      The aboleth can breathe air and water.
    Mucous Cloud.
      While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A
      creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack
      while within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.
      On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased
      creature can breathe only underwater.
    Probing Telepathy.
      If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the
      aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see
      the creature.

    # Actions

    Multiattack.
      The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.
    Tentacle.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6
      + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
      on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease
      has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures
      disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes
      translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it
      is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another
      disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is
      outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10
      minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have
      passed.
    Tail.
      Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. Hit: 15 (3d6
      + 5) bludgeoning damage.
    Enslave.
      The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. The
      target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically
      charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a
      different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is
      under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth
      and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any
      distance.
      
      Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the
      saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every
      24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at
      least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

    # Legendary Actions

    Detect.
      The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
    Tail Swipe.
      The aboleth makes one tail attack.
    Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).
      One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and
      the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.

    # Lair Actions

    Finally, aboleths have lair actions they can take on initiative
    count 20 when they are in their lair. These actions can take one
    of three forms.

    The aboleth can cast Phantasmal Force without components on any
    number of creatures it can see within 60 feet. This is a powerful
    ability but one that requires concentration; the aboleth can’t use
    other lair actions while concentrating on it. Also, targets that
    make their save against the aboleth’s spell are immune to it for
    the next 24 hours.

    The aboleth can also make pools of water within 90 feet flood
    outwards, forcing a DC 14 Strength save on any creature within 20
    feet of such pool. Failing the save means being pulled 20 feet
    into the water and knocked prone.

    Lastly, the aboleth can make water in its lair become a conduit
    for 2d6 (7 avg) psychic damage. Creatures take this damage if the
    aboleth can see them and if they fail a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw.

    These are pretty rough, but at least the aboleth needs to mix it
    up; it can’t use either of the last two lair actions twice in a
    row.

      Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the
      dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or
      become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw
      at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
      success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends
      for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for
      the next 24 hours.
    Breath Weapons.
      The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.
      
      Fire Breath. The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature
      in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66
      (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.
      
      Weakening Breath. The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each
      creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or
      have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and
      Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on

      - Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within

      creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving

      - A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot-radius around the dragon. Each
      creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed
      on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
      
      - Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a
      point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads
      around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until
      initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its

      Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the

      Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the
      dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or
      become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw
      at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
      success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends
      for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for
      the next 24 hours.
    Breath Weapons.
      The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.
      
      Cold Breath. The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each
      creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw,
      taking 67 (15d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
      on a successful one.
      
      Paralyzing Breath. The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 90- foot
      cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution
      saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
      saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
      itself on a success.
    Change Shape.
      The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a
      challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form.
      It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or
      carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).
      
      In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice,
      ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions,
      and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action.
      Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the
      new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
