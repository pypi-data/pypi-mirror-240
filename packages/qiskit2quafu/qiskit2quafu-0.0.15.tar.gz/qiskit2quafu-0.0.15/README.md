# Introduction
This package converts the circuit of qiskit into a circuit supported by quafu.
The converted circuit can be input to the cloud platform for processing.
To upload the task, refer to https://scq-cloud.github.io/
In addition, it also supports Hamilton measurement and Variational optimization
