    ----------
    sx : 3d array
        Social best, i.e., the best particle so far. An array of shape `(N, 1, d)`,

    xtol : 1d array
        Tolerance for average changes in the objective minimizer before terminating the
        solver. An array of shape `(N,)`.
    ftol : 1d array
        Number of iterations to wait before terminating the solver if no improvement is
        witnessed. An array of shape `(N,)`.
    current_patience_level : 2d array of ints
        Current patience level, i.e., for how many iterations the tolerances have been
        met. An array of shape `(N, 2)`, where the first column corresponds to the
        tolerance in `x`, and the second column in `f`. This array is modified in-place.

    -------
    tuple of 1d arrays
        Returns the current termination criteria for `x` and `f`, respectively, for each
        vectorized problem.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of bool, str, range_min, range_max
        Returns whether the solver should terminate, and the reason why. The reason can
