### Headless render and CI

xvfb-run --auto-servernum minecraft-render ...
```


### Notes

<https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Models#Block_states>

- Rework system
- Detach Jar from data reading (interface to provide info, allow for directory sources, or prioritized stacks)
- Incorporate blockstates to configure properly
- Rotate as needed (see: stairs etc)
