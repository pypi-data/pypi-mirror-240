    """
    Args:
        x: The data on which to compute the softmax (anything #ak.to_layout recognizes).
        axis (None or int): If None, combine all values from the array into
            a single scalar result; if an int, group by that axis: `0` is the
            outermost, `1` is the first level of nested lists, etc., and
            negative `axis` counts from the innermost: `-1` is the innermost,
            `-2` is the next level up, etc.
        keepdims (bool): If False, this function decreases the number of
            dimensions by 1; if True, the output values are wrapped in a new
            length-1 dimension so that the result of this operation may be
            broadcasted with the original array.
        mask_identity (bool): If True, the application of this function on
            empty lists results in None (an option type); otherwise, the
            calculation is followed through with the reducers' identities,
            usually resulting in floating-point `nan`.
        highlevel (bool): If True, return an #ak.Array; otherwise, return
            a low-level #ak.contents.Content subclass.
        behavior (None or dict): Custom #ak.behavior for the output array, if
            high-level.

    Computes the softmax in each group of elements from `x` (many
    types supported, including all Awkward Arrays and Records). The grouping
    is performed the same way as for reducers, though this operation is not a
    reducer and has no identity.

    This function has no NumPy equivalent.

    Passing all arguments to the reducers, the softmax is calculated as

        np.exp(x) / ak.sum(np.exp(x))

    See #ak.sum for a complete description of handling nested lists and
    missing values (None) in reducers, and #ak.mean for an example with another
    non-reducer.
