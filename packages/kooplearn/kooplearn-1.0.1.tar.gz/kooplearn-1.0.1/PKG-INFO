# `kooplearn`: Learn Koopman and transfer operators of Dynamical Systems

`kooplearn` is a Python library designed for learning Koopman operators or transfer operators associated with dynamical systems. It provides an array of algorithms for model training and analysis, enabling users to perform forecasting, spectral decomposition, and modal decomposition based on the learned operator.

Please note that `kooplearn` is currently under active development, and while we are continuously adding new features and improvements, some parts of the library might still be a work in progress.

## Features

- Implement different algorithms to learn Koopman or transfer operators for dynamical systems.
- Perform forecasting using the learned operators.
- Conduct spectral decomposition of the learned operator.
- Perform modal decomposition for further analysis.
  
## Installation
```bash
pip install kooplearn
# Or to install the latest version of kooplearn from git:
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/CSML-IIT-UCL/kooplearn.git
```
