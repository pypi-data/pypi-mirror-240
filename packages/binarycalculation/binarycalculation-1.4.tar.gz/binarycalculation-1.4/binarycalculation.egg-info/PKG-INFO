## Binary Number Calculations
Binary number calculations is python module for binary number calculations. This library could calculate binary addition, binary subtraction, binary multiplication, binary division. For bonus part, this library could help to convert decimal number into binary number, and vice-versa.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Binary Number Calculations.
To install, run this command:
```
pip install binarycalculation
```

## Usage
```
# import BinaryNumber module
from binarycalculation import binarycalculation

binaryOne = "11110001"
binaryTwo = "11101110"

# binary addition
# result: 111011111
binaryAddition = binarycalculation.processBinaryAddition(binaryOne, binaryTwo)
print(binaryAddition)

# binary subtraction
# result: 11
binarySubtraction = binarycalculation.processBinarySubtraction(binaryOne, binaryTwo)
print(binarySubtraction)

# binary multiplication
# result: 1110000000001110
binaryMultiplication = binarycalculation.processBinaryMultiplication(binaryOne, binaryTwo)
print(binaryMultiplication)

# binary subtraction
# result: 1 
# Remainder : 11
# the processBinaryDivision function return two value, result and remainder.
binaryDivision = binarycalculation.processBinaryDivision(binaryOne, binaryTwo)
print(binaryDivision)

# convert binary number to decimal
# result: 241
binaryToDecimal = binarycalculation.convertBinaryToDecimal(binaryOne)
print(binaryToDecimal)

# convert decimal number to binary
# result: 11110001
decimalToBinary = binarycalculation.convertDecimalToBinary(241)
print(decimalToBinary)

```
